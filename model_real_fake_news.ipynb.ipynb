              " 'new questions are being asked about president donald trump s ability to lead after he slurred his words during a speech about his jerusalem decision. possible reasons for this include: fatigue, a dry mouth (the white house explanation), the use of drugs or alcohol, a problem with his dentures or more troubling issues dealing with his mental or physical health. morning joe reported this morning that, unlike other presidents, trump has opted not to get his physicals at the walter reed army medical center.questions about trump s mental stability have been growing over the last few months. while he has never been viewed as a stable person in the traditional sense, his tweets and comments have gotten more erratic. he was widely criticized recently when he retweeted several anti-muslim videos that were posted by radicals in the united kingdom.one psychiatrist talk to msnbc s lawrence o donnel about his impressions of trump s state of mind.many think that any degradation in trump s mental state may be due to the increased pressure he is feeling from robert mueller s investigations into collusion between his campaign and the russian government. this has increased since former national security advisor michael flynn pleaded guilty to lying to the fbi.all of this talk is leading to more people to ask if trump should be removed from office, citing the 25th amendment to the u.s. constitution. rep. jamie d. raskin (d-md) has circulated a  dear colleague  letter suggesting just that. as published in the washington post, it says: please join a rapidly growing group of colleagues in cosponsoring h.r. 1987, the oversight commission on presidential capacity act. it sets up and defines the congressionally-appointed  body  called for by the 25th amendment. under section 4 of the 25th amendment, the vice-president and a majority of the cabinet or the vice-president and a majority of  such other body as congress may by law provide  can determine that the president is for reasons of physical or mental incapacity unable to discharge the powers and duties of his office. the 25th amendment was added to the constitution in 1967, but in the last 50 years congress never created the  body  that its language contemplated. perhaps it never occurred to prior congresses that setting up this body was necessary. for obvious reasons, it is indeed necessary, and now is the time for us to do it. while the republicans in the cabinet and congress may not yet be ready to take this step, it is out there.featured image via andrew burton/getty images',\n",
              " 'on wednesday, donald trump took a step no previous president had ever dared to consider. he has declared that the united states now officially recognizes the city of jerusalem as the capital of israel, and announced plans to move the american embassy from tel aviv to the holy city.the only problem is, the city isn t just holy to the country of israel.while trump indicated that he wasn t  taking a position  on any contested land, that s really a misleading statement, since declaring jerusalem as the capital of israel in effect gives the city to the israelis, a position that essentially declares the debate on who all of the land belongs to over.saeb erekat, the chief palestinian negotiator in the peace process, was quick to respond, saying that trump had  destroyed any possibility of peace  and that he was  pushing this region towards chaos [and] violence. mustafa marghouti, an independent palestinian politician, told al-jazeera that: this is not a single act. this us administration that did not speak even once about a two-state solution. this american administration did not say or mention the words  palestinian state  once. this american administration has failed to exercise any pressure on israel on the issue of settlements, although israel has enhanced settlement activities in the occupied territories by no less than 100 percent since president trump was elected. many expect to see outrage across the middle east as news of the decision comes in.the european union, for their part, insists that their position has not changed, and issued a statement almost immediately declaring that they intended to continue working toward recognizing jerusalem as the capital of two distinct states   israel and palestine.just as he does here at home, trump seems to be uniting people against him, even some that seem to be unlikely pairings. both the president of turkey, recep tayyip erdogan, and king abdullah ii of jordan warned that ignoring the palestinian, muslim, and christian rights in jerusalem will only fuel further extremism and undermine the war against terrorism. but the decision does make trump s evangelical supporters in america happy. their desire to hasten the end of days has been a constant source of bafflement for those seeking to understand the strange relationship between the jewish state and evangelicalism. according to christian traditions, the jews will all die in the apocalypse, as will everyone who doesn t share their specific beliefs.no wonder they re mostly republicans.watch trump s announcement here:featured image via chip somodevilla/getty images',\n",
              " 'president donald trump announced yesterday that he plans to formally recognize jerusalem as the capital of israel. while this is left most pundits perplexed, the reasoning is clear. trump wants to divert attention from robert mueller s investigation. it is no coincidence that the day after the news broke that deutsche bank has received subpoenas for information on the trump family s assets, that this jerusalem decision was announced. what could be a bigger news story than getting this information? a blow up in the middle east.look at the reaction world leaders have had to this announcement. american allies throughout the middle east and europe have asked trump not to do this and have stressed how dangerous a statement this is. us news and world report put this out today: the mere consideration of trump changing the status quo sparked a renewed u.s. security warning on tuesday. america s consulate in jerusalem ordered u.s. personnel and their families to avoid visiting jerusalem s old city or the west bank, and urged american citizens in general to avoid places with increased police or military presence. it is worth noting that while trump will formally announce that the u.s. will recognize jerusalem as israel s capital, there is no movement underway to relocate the embassy from tel aviv. in fact, he has signed an order to delay that decision for another six months. this move is necessary due to the 1995 jerusalem embassy act, which mandated the embassy be moved. it also allowed the president to delay that by six months and every president since that act became law has done so this way.the atlantic has even compared this decision to trump  wagging the dog,  a reference to a movie where a u.s. president goes to war with albania to take the public s attention away from his own scandals involving a mistress. the film was viewed as a parody of president bill clinton s military actions in afghanistan and sudan after he acknowledged an affair with monica lewinsky.while whether or not clinton attacked other countries to distract the nation from his actions with lewinsky may be a point that is up for debate, it is clear that trump likes to do things to distract the public s attention. catherine rampell wrote about this tactic late last year in the washington post. she wrote: welcome to 2017, the ouroboros of distractions, where every terrible thing is a head-fake for a ruse for a diversion for a misdirection from something else much, much worse. trump makes announcements, sends tweets and says things without any thought to the real world consequences that follow. experts in the middle east fear that the jerusalem announcement will lead to real deaths. many people worry  that his thoughtless and impetuous tweets will lead to a nuclear war. his thoughtless comments confuse and enrage many.by making such a move, for such purely personal reasons, trump is proving, once again, that he is not fit to be president of a condo association, much less of the united states.featured image by andrew burton/getty images.',\n",

choices before them.they can vote for the democrat and prove that they refuse to tolerate an accused child molester and sexual predator being in their party and in the senate, or they can put political power over the morality they have long preached about.in other words, they can either put power over principles or put principles over power.they can t do both.and while they are damned if they do and damned if they don t, choosing the latter of those two options would be a far better and more honorable choice.some things go above politics, and sexual assault is, and rightfully should, be one of them.voting for moore for the sake of political power throws every sexual assault victim under the bus. it will especially be a slap in the face of women across the country, a major voting block that has already been overwhelmingly voting democrat for many years.if republicans want to have any chance of surviving as a legitimate political party for many more decades to come, it is critical that they start by drawing a line in the sand when it comes to moore and the people who defend him such as donald trump.this starting point alone can restore a little of the respect the gop has lost. perhaps then, they ll even be courageous enough to rejects the racists and the sexists and the nazis, which will do more to grow the ranks of the party than the southern strategy ever did.and then the republican party can get past being a haven for extremists and anti-government zealots and get on the road to becoming a sane party with real ideas instead of simply opposing and obstructing at every turn, which has not been good for the country at all.america has lost its respect of the international community and our reputation has been seriously sullied. letting moore step inside the senate would send a message to the world that america supports child molestation and the sexual assault and harassment of women.such a message from the republican party smacks of hypocrisy. after all, we are talking about the same party that constantly bring up the sexual assault allegations against bill clinton.but just like how they constantly bring up abraham lincoln in an attempt to claim that the republican party must still be great, their rhetoric about bill clinton is old and tired and not really that relevant today. the gop is far removed from the days of lincoln. and bill clinton was president two decades ago and if he were running today he would not win. the sexual assault allegations alone would prevent him from even getting on the ballot.however, by supporting donald trump, who was accused by a dozen women of sexual assault during the 2016 campaign, republicans committed a serious hypocrisy that undermines their bill clinton talking point.if moore wins next month, republicans will only be doubling down on that hypocrisy and they ll be past the point of no return. and the consequences will be severe.america is more diverse than ever before. women have emerged as a force to be reckoned with after decades of old white guys running the show. minorities are also set to become the majority of the population, and once that scale tips, the gop will no longer be able to be the party of white people. it just won t work.it s just a matter of time, and time is running out for the republican party.and that s why they must rise above politics and stand for something bigger than themselves.sexual assault and child molestation should not be rewarded with power and prestige. and that should go beyond the political arena as well, whether the behavior is coming from a corporate ceo or the part-owner of a website or a church leader or any other position of power.republicans need to start practicing the  morality  they preach and they can do that by putting politics aside and do the right thing.that s what republicans did in 1860 when they voted for a dark horse candidate as their flagbearer. lincoln then put politics aside to assemble one of the greatest cabinets in our history, bringing together liberal and conservative republicans and even a democrat or two.and even though lincoln remained neutral at first and the politics of day made it really difficult, he made the decision to put politics aside and pushed for the passage of the 13th amendment. such a move at the time could have cost lincoln a second term, but he did it anyway.lincoln put principle over power in the face of an even more contentious and hateful political environment than we are experiencing today. it s time for republicans to do the same now.seven years ago, my first article for this site explained how republicans have put power over principles for decades to the detriment of our progress towards a better future for everyone.today, i want inform my loyal readers that this will be my final article for addicting info.it has been an honor and a privilege to write here for so many years. i must first thank my readers for making this job possible. knowing that i was informing so many people across the country and around the world motivated me to make writing about politics my career. and now it is time to move on in order to further pursue that goal.it is hard to leave the best job one has ever had. through the years, i have made friends and lost friends. i have been here through the struggles and the triumphs. and i have done that while drastically improving as a writer and a person along the way.with that being said, it is especially hard to leave the people i work with, and there are many, both past and present, who

colleagues and i would not be where i am without you.last, but not least, i want to thank matthew desmond for believing in me enough to give me my start and keep me around all these years. you have been the best boss i could ever have hoped for and your friendship and support has been invaluable to me. you ve been an inspiration and i will always be grateful and fiercely loyal to you. you

              " 'former reality show star donald trump has repeatedly refused to be held responsible for the words that come out of his own mouth, even when it s on tape. for example, the infamous access hollywood tape in which he suggests that because he s powerful, he can just grab women by their p-ssies. trump defended sexual harasser and fox news host (yeah, i know that s redundant) bill o reilly in the recent past and even more recently, he has defended alleged pedophile and alabama senate candidate roy moore. so, defending perverts is just another day for donald trump.here s a quick reminder of what trump said on the p*ssy grabbing tape: you know i m automatically attracted to beautiful [women]   i just start kissing them. it s like a magnet. just kiss. i don t even wait. and when you re a star, they let you do it. you can do anything. grab them by the pussy. you can do anything. the new york times reports that even after trump made an almost-apology after the tape was revealed, he still told a senator and an adviser that the access hollywood tape may not be authentic.but something deeper has been consuming mr. trump. he sees the calls for mr. moore to step aside as a version of the response to the now-famous  access hollywood  tape, in which he boasted about grabbing women s genitalia, and the flood of groping accusations against him that followed soon after. he suggested to a senator earlier this year that it was not authentic, and repeated that claim to an adviser more recently.so, to reiterate, trump told an adviser recently that the video and tape of him talking about perving on women is fake news. and he also told that to a senator after it was released.we see a pattern here. maybe trump s cult-like following will believe this crap but the rest of us remember that tape all too well. that tape was an indicating factor that donald j. trump is unfit for office, morally and intellectually.photo by chip somodevilla/getty images',\n",

              " 'president donald trump has overturned another obama-era legislation, this time the 2014 ban on trophy hunting permits, particularly those of elephants killed in zimbabwe and zambia, a us fish and wildlife service official has confirmed. trump s sons, don jr., and eric, love being trophy-hunting douchebags and this will allow them to be even more blatant about it.don jr., has hunted elephants before, and elephants are listed as endangered under the endangered species act. that exact act also contained a provision that allows for the granting of permits for the trophy-hunting of elephants if the hunters can prove that the demise of the singular animal in question helped benefit the conservation of the entire species. it s unlikely the trump sons care about conservation, and only about their own glory and bragging rights.nevertheless, a spokesman for fish and wildlife said,  legal, well-regulated sport hunting as part of a sound management program can benefit the conservation of certain species by providing incentives to local communities to conserve the species and by putting much-needed revenue back into conservation. despite large-scale conservation efforts, the wild elephant population in africa plummeted 30% overall between 2007 and 2014 and by as much as 75% in some areas as a result of ivory poaching, but that is just the tip of the iceberg. prior to european colonization in the early 20th century, it is estimated that the wild elephant population in africa was approximately 20 million, but dropped to 1.7 million by 1979. that number looks even more bleak when at last count in 2016 there were only just over 352,000 of the animals remaining on africa s savanna in a survey where namibia did not release any figures and surveys in south sudan and the central african republic were postponed due to armed conflict.last year, 182 countries signed an agreement to end the legal ivory trade in domestic markets, however, zimbabwe is one of few that has tried to have that ban lifted and soon they may be successful with the help of president trump. this new change would only apply to zimbabwe and zambia, but with robert mugabe s recent removal and the military seizing control of zimbabwe, they have bigger issues to deal with at the moment.it makes you wonder why president trump would be so interested in elephant poaching. is it another distraction, this time from the possibility of zimbabwe falling into a constitutional crisis? could it be because he just likes the look of ivory in trump tower?or is it simply because trumps just miss slaughtering endangered wildlife for the sheer pleasure of it?figures. pic.twitter.com/7lrfjeqaiy  snarkar?ni  ?

[emphasis mine]by contrast, sanders is perfectly fine with saying that paul manafort s indictment has nothing whatsoever to do with trump. she had no issue spinning trump s tax breaks for the wealthy into a $4,000/year raise for american families. despite being a woman, she s perfectly fine saying that the women accusing trump of sexual assault are all lying simply because that s trump s position. as for the entire russia scandal, including a report that trump has lost his mind over it, horsey says: taking the offensive, sanders confidently delivered the new republican talking point that, if anyone were guilty of colluding with moscow, it was hillary clinton   which is the boldest evasion anyone in the trump camp has come up with, so far.

(don jr. originally lied, saying that the meeting was about reinstating adoptions between us and russia, but then released his own emails that proved he d lied.)then the dnc was hacked, and the hack was traced back to russia. trump even called on russia to release hillary s missing emails during the rnc convention; a comment that has been analyzed again and again with some dismissing it as a joke and others saying it was evidence of something deeper.there s currently no evidence that anything actually came of that june 2016 meeting. however, if papadopoulos can back up what he said in his plea agreement about the campaign knowing, then it stops being a scandal and becomes active collusion.manafort and gates have been charged with things like money laundering, failure to register as foreign agents, etc. the key with these two is whether mueller can get them to roll over on trump and other highly placed officials in exchange for lesser charges.papadopoulos, on the other hand, told the fbi that his russian contacts weren t anyone important and that they had nothing to do with trump, his campaign, or the election. we now know he was in europe, meeting with russians and trying arrange meetings between none other than vladimir putin and donald trump. there s a direct line back to the campaign there, whereas the charges against manafort and gates could be seen as only tangentially related.papadopoulos is already a cooperating witness in mueller s investigation, and there is no evidence yet that manafort or gates have flipped, or will flip. and since everything about papadopoulos  arrest has to do with his activities on the campaign, that makes him far more dangerous to trump right now than gates and manafort.featured image via chip somodevilla/getty images',\n",

              " 'in a brand-new expos  on mother jones, investigative journalist ari berman delves into an aspect of the 2016 election that has been largely ignored in the shadow of controversies over internal dnc politics, shifting blame, and what is now known to be concrete russian interference: voter suppression.on the heels of a report berman summarized back in september, his article for the november-december issue of the liberal stalwart magazine continues where he left off. anecdotal evidence of individual voters who were prevented from voting in wisconsin during the presidential election all adds up to a picture that explains the numbers in the university of wisconsin-madison study that berman cites in his summary.the study, completed by uw-madison s professor of political science, kenneth mayer, shows a survey in two large counties in wisconsin that asked whether respondents were either prevented or deterred from voting in 2016 by the new voter id law in effect for the first time in that election. the results of the survey were stunning: more than 11 percent of respondents said they were deterred, and that 6 percent   more than half of the nonvoters   were prevented entirely. if those sound like small numbers, bear with me.in the course of research, voters were asked why they didn t vote, how engaged they were in the election, what types of id they possessed, how confident they were in the final vote count, and their general demographics. the survey never required any respondent to answer who they may have voted for.possibly the most distressing part of the findings was how disproportionately the voter id law affected low-income and minority voters: more than 21 percent of households under $25,000 of income per year were deterred; that number dropped to just over 7 percent for those above that line. the demarcation between white and black voters was even more stark, with just of 8 percent of white voters reporting trouble and 27.5 percent of african-americans reporting the same.what does all that add up to?as berman notes in the new piece for mj, wisconsin showed the second-highest voter turnout in the united states in both 2008 and 2012, but just four years later, participation was the lowest it had been in 16 years.so let s get back to those numbers.in just the two counties that were surveyed, dane and milwaukee, the percentage of registered voters who were adversely affected by the new voter id law represents a low estimate of nearly 17,000 and an upper estimate of 23,252 voters. in fact, the study points out, the 11.2 percent nonvoter estimate is actually low in itself, as it doesn t take into account voters who were deterred from even registering by the new law.if every single one of those in the study who answered that they were deterred or prevented from voting had actually cast a vote that counted, voter turnout would have increased by 2.24 percent. and that seems like an incredibly small number, until you extrapolate that across the state. the wisconsin election commission estimated that 3.1 million voters turned out for the 2016 presidential election. that means 69,440 voters   under a conservative estimate   were disenfranchised entirely by the new voter id law.donald trump s margin of victory in the state? less than a third of that.given that the vast majority of disenfranchised voters, although they were not asked their political affiliations, were demographically more likely to vote for hillary clinton than for donald trump, it hardly requires extrapolation to conclude that, at least in the state of wisconsin, trump was right.the vote was rigged.featured image via scott olson/getty images',\n",

              " ' education standards,  it seems, is now a term fraught with intent. by and large, standards are set by the states that uphold them, with localities left to decide how best to implement those standards through lesson plans, specialized curriculum, and testing. but if you re a voter, you have at some point checked a box on a ballot for someone on a school board, or at the very least a school superintendent. that means that in a time like now, when the phrase  all politics is local  has taken on the most literal meaning you can imagine, local politics can sometimes determine what your children learn.to make matters worse, textbook manufacturers are as subject to political winds   and capitalism   as the next industry. that means they want to produce their books in markets where they can sell the most, which gives big states like california and texas, whose student populations vastly outmatch those of other states, huge influence over education standards even outside their borders.when a state is reliably  blue,  as california is, that can shake out favorably for proponents of science, history, civics   basically everything where facts are involved. but when a state is more often  red,  as in the case of texas, it can be bad for those same things.what happens, though, when a state is more  purple,  like new mexico?we re finding out now. the new science education standards for the southwestern state are raising eyebrows, and that s saying something for a state in which the long-serving public education secretary resigned after 7 years on the job. hanna skandera, who was appointed by republican governor susana martinez, had faced intense scrutiny from both democratic lawmakers and from teachers in the state over previously proposed education reforms.  a through f   grading for young elementary students and a variety of other changes skandera had sought while serving in the same capacity in florida under governor jeb! bush made her a target of teachers  unions and parent groups across the state.martinez was very unhappy about the pressure that caused skandera to resign.but the proposed changes to science in new mexico were initially based on the next generation science standards, guidelines released back in 2013 and eventually passed by both chambers of the new mexico legislature. it was when the proposed changes made it to governor martinez  desk that issues arose. she vetoed the bill, citing her authority to properly  vet  the new standards.now those standards look considerably different than what the legislature passed.mother jones outlined some of the changes:two democrats in the state, representing districts 10 and 33, have pointed squarely at governor martinez in an op-ed in the las cruces sun-news:during one of the committee hearings, a former member of her staff admitted the reason for the governor s decision.  toward the end of my tenure at the public education department, i was tasked to edit and change some of the language in the standards to make them politically sanitized. no matter whether changes come from school boards, legislatures, or directly from a governor s office, changes to education standards should never be politicized. unless this is stopped, new mexico is just setting a new standard for how other states might politicize them in the future.featured image via peter macdiarmid/getty images',\n",

in that case, children. and it could be seen this way in parkway s case, too, since standing for the national anthem can be considered saluting the flag. the school has delivered an ultimatum to its student athletes: stand during the national anthem or else.trump set off a firestorm by calling for nfl owners to fire players who sit or kneel (or stay in the locker room) during the national anthem. despite the backlash, he s doubled down, and tripled down, and quadrupled down on it, spending a lot of time on twitter slamming the nfl and completely ignoring the reasons behind the protests (to say nothing of his continued slights to puerto rico, which is now in the midst of a humanitarian crisis thanks to back-to-back powerful hurricanes).and now, high schools are starting to weigh in, and it may well be illegal for them to do so. despite sports being extra-curricular, this is still a school official forcing his students to worship a symbol. and parkway high school s principal has dragged politics into his athletic program with an ill-advised letter violating the first amendment rights of students.featured image via mark wilson/getty images',\n",

              " 'alabama s republican runoff election for jeff sessions  vacant senate seat has come to its end, and the candidate that will go up against democrat doug jones in december s general election is none other than roy moore. moore is the former chief justice of alabama s state supreme court, and he s the one who ordered all of alabama s probate judges to defy the u.s. supreme court s ruling on same-sex marriage in 2013.but moore wasn t donald trump s candidate. luther strange, who has been holding sessions  seat, was the man backed by trump. in fact, trump was at a political rally for strange last friday when he called for nfl players who kneel during the national anthem to be fired. the president s endorsement usually helps a candidate, yet it s moore who just won. here s a little background on moore: he was yanked from the alabama supreme court s bench in 2003 for refusing to remove a massive monument to the bible s 10 commandments from the grounds of the courthouse. that s considered a violation of the first amendment since it constitutes a government endorsement of one religion.in 2012, moore won his job back, then called same-sex relationships  sodomy,  and decried the immorality of it all in the wake of the supreme court legalizing same-sex marriage across all 50 states. he wanted to bar democratic rep. keith ellison from serving in office because he s a muslim, and he accused obama of using our military for social experiments (including wiping out  don t ask, don t tell  and allowing transgender individuals to serve).he has also defended putin because putin seems to agree with him on the issue of lgbtq rights. one might think that would earn him trump s endorsement, but somehow, it didn t.all of that should have made this election a tossup given conservatives  current love of trump, but it didn t. moore was polling ahead of strange pretty much the entire time. why?well, trump, for starters. that buffoon endorsed luther strange and bragged about it all over twitter, up to and including through today. he boasted that strange s numbers had skyrocketed since his endorsement, but according to nbc news, trump s endorsement actually pushed people towards moore. trump won alabama by double digits last year, but it seems they re souring towards him now.that makes this trump s fault, at least partly. voters claimed that his endorsement didn t affect them one way or another, but those who were influenced by trump said he pushed them away from strange. what that means is that some republican voters chose moore because trump backed the other candidate.that s a massive blow to trump. maybe alabama voters are ashamed of trump, and they d have good reason to feel that way. for instance, speaking on the  rick and bubba  radio show, which is based out of birmingham, trump said: luther strange is going to be a great senator. he loves alabama, he loves the states and he loves the country. he will absolutely win against the democrat.ray will have a hard time. if luther wins, the democrats will hardly fight. if ray wins, [democrats] will pour in $30 million. moore s first name is roy. when rick burgess, one of the show s hosts, pointed out that he d gotten roy s name wrong, trump actually said that it s not a good sign if the president doesn t know his name. then he said: i don t know that much about roy moore. roy moore is going to have a very hard time getting elected against the democrat.against luther they won t even fight. when news of moore s win came out, trump tweeted the following:as noted above, the general election is december 12. that tweet has since been deleted, and replaced with one noting the correct month for the general.where is trump s influence, then? rosie gray of the atlantic said: the outcome of the special election primary will help answer the question of  who is more influential with trump s base: trump himself, or the constellation of powerful voices on the right to whom base voters listen and who are supporting moore? well, it seems that trump doesn t have the influence he thinks he does. especially given that strange was likely a far better candidate for senate than moore ever could be. moore is an absolute disaster. he s a danger to the u.s., and in deep-red alabama, there s very little chance that a democrat can win sessions  senate seat. and trump s endorsement of strange is partly responsible for this. he s a blight on the gop and a blight on the nation as a whole. he s dangerous, and moore s election is evidence of that.featured image via alex wong/getty images',\n",

              " 'cnn is now reporting that, after months of confusion over the scope of the investigation into russian election interference, the irs is now working with special counsel robert mueller and his team. the irs had previously also balked at the no-knock raid on former trump campaign chairman paul manafort s home at the beginning of august.those concerns are clearly resolved at this point, as the independent government tax agency is now voluntarily sharing information with mueller s squad.mueller and the irs worked jointly with the treasury department to come to an agreement over the matter, which was in question because of the specifics of assistant attorney general rod rosenstein s written order for the special counsel, which allowed for mueller to look into  any matters that arose or may arise directly from the investigation.  mueller s interpretation of that order included years of tax filings, as possible evidence of financial crimes.according to cnn, the irs had already been working with the fbi on a probe of manafort before the election, sending criminal investigators to look into potential tax evasion and money laundering. the irs is also sharing information with mueller about michael flynn, although it is uncertain if flynn was being investigated for anything similar prior to november.to be perfectly clear, the irs s previous objections to the manafort raid were not over its propriety, but whether or not it would interfere with their own investigation of manafort, whose dealings with former ukrainian president viktor yanukovych made him suspect in almost every way back here on american soil. irs agents declined to participate in the raid, which mueller elected to go ahead with using only fbi agents for assistance. once inside, the team gathered up tax and other financial documents, which have since prompted mueller s team to warn manafort that they intend to charge him with tax and financial crimes.all of this, of course, brings back the question of whether or not robert mueller will have   or whether he already does have   access to donald trump s tax returns. there is little doubt that if the investigation turns up evidence of financial crimes committed by either manafort or flynn, the next logical place to look for evidence of collusion is in trump s own returns.and that, ladies and gentlemen, is the last thing donald trump wants.featured image via andrew burton/getty images',\n",

              " 'a backlash has ensued after donald trump launched a war against black athletes who choose to sit rather than stand during the national anthem in protest of racial inequality and police brutality. gen. michael hayden, a retired united states air force four-star general, who served in the military for 39 years, penned a column which savages the former reality show star over his nfl twitter tantrums. at first, hayden wasn t  enthusiastic  about throwing his support behind colin kaepernick, the former san francisco 49ers quarterback who started the silent protest of kneeling during the anthem.hayden, who served as national security adviser and head the cia after he left the military, wrote that the issues kaepernick raised  were both real and sincerely held. but then trump crossed the line when he spoke to a crowd in deep red alabama and called black athletes who kneel  sons of bitches.  hayden wrote that it s  the way he has previously treated other groups like mexicans (murderers and rapists), intelligence professionals (nazis), immigrants (deeply unfair), refugees (dangerous), and muslims (they hate us). as a 39-year military veteran, i think i know something about the flag, the anthem, patriotism, and i think i know why we fight,  he wrote.  it s not to allow the president to divide us by wrapping himself in the national banner. i never imagined myself saying this before friday, but if now forced to choose in this dispute, put me down with kaepernick. trump lashes out at everyone, especially minorities in order to rile up his base. he literally loves conflict and chaos. when you elect a former reality show star to lead the most powerful country on earth, you re begging for controversy and that s what trump s base wants. trump had zero political experience for the job he seems to loathe so much and yet, here he is. trump uses his twitter account to divide the nation, and sometimes to try to start a war.after trump is out of office, we re really going to have to  make america great again  but it will take years to correct all of the harm he s done to this country.photo: alex wong via getty images',\n",
              " 'graham-cassidy, the latest and worst in a line of republican healthcare bills collectively dubbed  trumpcare,  looks dead. senator susan collins (r-me) just joined senators john mccain (r-az) and rand paul (r-ky) as one of the few to break party lines and refuse to vote for the bill. while not everyone is against the bill for the best of reasons, susan collins could not have been more clear about the many issues she had with the legislation.here s her statement: first, both proposals make sweeping changes and cuts in the medicaid program. expert projections show that more than $1 trillion would be taken out of the medicaid program between the years 2020 and 2036. this would have a devastating impact to a program that has been on the books for 50 years and provides health care to our most vulnerable citizens, including disabled children and low-income seniors.second, both bills open the door for states to weaken protections for people with pre-existing conditions, such as asthma, cancer, heart disease, arthritis, and diabetes. some states could allow higher premiums for individuals with pre-existing conditions, potentially making their insurance unaffordable. states could also limit specific categories of benefits for affordable care act policies, such as eliminating coverage for mental health or substance abuse treatment.third, physicians, patient advocates, insurers, and hospitals agree that both versions of this legislation would lead to higher premiums and reduced coverage for tens of millions of americans.the cbo s analysis on the earlier version of the bill, incomplete though it is due to time constraints, confirms that this bill will have a substantially negative impact on the number of people covered by insurance.there has been some discussion that the new version of the bil includes additional money for my home state of maine. the fact is, maine still loses money under whichever version of the graham-cassidy bill we consider because the bills use what could be described as a  give with one hand, take with the other  distribution model. huge medicaid cuts down the road more than offset any short-term influx of money. but even more important, if senators can adjust a funding formula over a weekend to help a single state, they could just as easily adjust that formula to hurt that state. this is simply not the way that we should be approaching an important and complex issue that must be handled thoughtfully and fairly for all americans. there you have it   susan collins just hammered the final nail into trumpcare s coffin.on september 30th, a special rule allowing republicans to pass legislation with only a simple majority (50 votes and a tiebreak) will expire. after that, any healthcare legislation that republicans want to pass will have to get at least eight democrats on board.republicans can t govern or even get their own party to agree, so good luck with that.featured image via alex wong/getty images',\n",

              " 'jack links, which is a very popular maker of beef jerky, just released a brand-new ad that is absolutely disgusting. it s supposed to give you facts about building muscle, and how beef jerky can aid you in that endeavor, but it does so as a direct appeal to nazis and other white supremacists. seriously.the 30-second spot features green bay packers linebacker clay matthews, who literally says the following, word for word, at the beginning of the ad: i m the product of hard work, superior genetics, norse mythology, and protein. the ad also shows primates putting muscle fibers back together, which could be seen as promoting slavery and anti-semitism, since racists and anti-semites have traditionally used monkeys to disparage black people and jews. watch below: superior genetics  is what white supremacy and anti-semitism are all about. sure, on their planet, people are people, but whites have superior genes and built the whole world, and everyone needs to understand that. adolf hitler s aryan race was all about superior genetics, the white supremacists and nazis in this country push that, so there s no getting away from the fact that the term is a dog whistle to white supremacy.what about the  norse mythology  claim, though? most of our nazis and white supremacists want to preserve western european genetics. norse mythology is scandinavian, so what the hell? it turns out that this is also an appeal to a very racist brand of odinism, which, unfortunately, does have a fairly strong history in the u.s. among the white supremacist hate groups.this brand of odinism was popular in nazi germany, and it s popular among today s white supremacists, including nazis, kkk members, skinheads, and others. the reason for that is  it sings the virtues of the tribe, or folk, strongly emphasizing genetic closeness. and it credits whites with building civilization and an ethic of individual responsibility,  according to the southern poverty law center. that s exactly what white supremacists want. no more mixing of races because that s  white genocide,  and an acceptance that whites are the superior race above all others.odinism is likely more appealing to these people than christianity because christianity (attempts) to emphasize inclusion and love of all, not the racial division they want. it also fits better with the anti-semitism these hate groups harbor than christianity does. however, many in these hate groups still call themselves christian and pervert christianity to suit their own needs, which those who actually promote christian ethics say is  a problem.  it s possible that particular conflict can drive white supremacists to odinism.jack links has a serious problem on its hands with this ad. they just branded themselves as openly white supremacist with a desire to appeal to the worst elements of our society. one might try to claim that they re just ignorant of the current social and political environments, but that s about as likely as trump not knowing who david duke is.featured image via video screen capture',\n",

              " 'by now, everyone knows that dylann roof, the south carolina white supremacist who shot up am historic black church in charleston south carolina, did it because the parishioners were black. they invited him to their worship service, and after he sat there with them for more than an hour, he killed them. well, roof has been sentenced to die, and his case is not in the appeals process. like all people, no matter how despicable, roof is entitled, via the law, to a competent defense. since he cannot afford his own team of attorneys, they have been provided for him in the form of public defenders. there s just one problem with that, though: according to dylann roof, his lawyers are the wrong color.appointed to represent roof are public defenders alexandra yates and sapna mirchandani, who are jewish and indian, respectively. those facts seem to be the only things that are wrong here, rather than their actual defense of roof. this isn t the first time race has entered into roof s court proceedings; he had similar mishaps with his original attorney during the trial portion of his ordeal. the man representing him during that time, david bruck, is jewish. roof said of the issues there: his ethnicity was a constant source of conflict even with my constant efforts to look past it. trust is a vital component in an attorney client relationship, and is important to the effectiveness of the defense. because of my political views, which are arguably religious, it will be impossible for me to trust two attorneys that are my political and biological enemies. to that end, the racist murderer, who seems to be more or less representing himself at this point, penned a missive from prison, firing his public defenders on the basis of their ethnicity:as if all of this weren t bad enough, roof threatened his original lawyer, david bruck, with death if he ever got out of prison.luckily, the judge presiding over roof s case sees his racism for what it is, and is denying this so-called  motion. in short, if anyone deserves the death penalty, it s this piece of less-than-human excrement. no sympathy here, despite my usual opposition to the death penalty. if anyone deserves to die for his crimes, it s dylann roof.featured image via video screen capture from abc news video',\n",
              " 'donald trump has been fundraising like crazy for his re-election campaign, having filed his papers the day he was inaugurated for his first term. but there s quite possibly an odd reason for his incessant begging for funds: according to reuters, he s using the money to pay for his defense team in the russia scandal.reuters spoke to two people who are familiar with the situation, but they were unable to determine how much has already been spent on legal fees. federal election laws allow candidates to spend private campaign donations on legal matters, but up until now, the legal matters in question dealt with routine and mundane things such as compliance requirements and ballot access issues.trump may well become the first president in the modern campaign finance era to use his donations to pay for a criminal defense in addition to routine legal matters. one of the biggest reasons that candidates shifted largely from public financing to private financing for their election campaigns is so they have greater flexibility in how they spend that money. that helps to give trump greater latitude to spend donations on his own legal defense. furthermore, since the russia scandal is something that may not have existed had he not been elected, trump and his family may well be legally free to spend their donors  dollars on russia.his campaign organization currently has nearly $12 million. when reuters asked trump s lead attorney how the bills were getting paid, he snapped,  that s none of your business. trump spent a large chunk of his campaign funding on his own properties during the 2016 election cycle, and has been spending government money at some of those same properties, lining his pockets with public dollars. his campaign has paid one law firm jones day almost $4 million, some of which probably did go to help with the russia probe. jones day has also responded to inquiries related to russia, including sending documents to congress on the campaign s behalf.here s the sad thing: his donors, whether they know where their money is going or not, would probably cheer their chance to help trump defeat the liberal conspiracy that is the russia probe. they think they re helping him get re-elected in 2020, so they think they re helping him defeat the great deep-state witch hunt.featured image via drew angerer/getty images',\n",
              " 'the military s budget is being massively expanded this year, and nobody is really sure why. the answer seems to be  because we can.  republicans in the senate have decided that the pentagon should receive even more money than trump s hawkish white house wanted, and is giving the military things it never requested and does not need. the 2018 national defense authorization act approves a budget of $696 billion, an annual increase of $80 billion. meanwhile, republicans are out to gut aid programs for low-income americans.so why aren t  deficit hawks  like paul ryan questioning where this money will come from? we re ballooning the deficit to kill people, and for what, exactly? the pentagon does not need the money. for example, the budget has allowed for 94 new f-35 lightning fighter jets. via bloomberg:the measure would authorize 94 f-35 jets made by lockheed martin corp., 24 more than requested by the president and seven more than the house agreed to in its version of the bill.oh, by the way, the budget is also illegal. why is that? well, a law passed in 2011 only allows $549 billion in base-related expenses. the united states has 800 military bases and hundreds of thousands of soldiers occupying nations around the globe. the budget as it stands recommends $640 billion:senate armed services committee chairman john mccain (r-ariz.) said during floor debate that his panel ignored the budget constraints set in law because responding to national security challenges requires more resources. the threats to our national security have not been more complex, severe, or daunting at any time in the past seven decades   and our job is to ensure we have a military capable of meeting those threats,  mccain said.  for too long, we have locked ourselves into making strategic decisions based on budget realities. it is time to start making budget decisions based on strategic realities. that s right. republicans think we should make  budget decisions based on strategic realities,  completely ignoring military-related deficits, in order to pay for jets (and other stuff) the military never asked for and does not need.or, maybe, the massive lobbying arm of the defense industry has more to do with it. they ve already spent tens of millions in 2017 alone to buy politicians and influence, and there s no slowing down.these two things are unrelated pic.twitter.com/3pgzzzrlj9  adam h. johnson (@adamjohnsonnyc) september 19, 2017what else could that money pay for? great question. common dreams has a great perspective on the true cost of needless military spending:put another way, with a $700 billion military budget, the u.s. would be spending more than three times as much as china on its military, and 10 times as much as russia. according to [the stockholm international peace research institute], the u.s. already accounts for more than a third of all military spending.yes, in the entire world. the united states, with about 1/25 of the world s population, is responsible for over 1/3 of the military spending worldwide. who are we preparing to fight, exactly?or with $80 billion a year, you could make public colleges and universities in the u.s. tuition-free. in fact, sanders s proposal was only estimated to cost the federal government $47 billion per year.if the additional military spending over the next 10 years instead went to pay off student debt, it could come close to wiping it out entirely.yet those kind of ideas, or universal healthcare coverage, are dismissed out-of-hand by republicans. maybe that s because the everyday people who would benefit most don t pay as well as insurance and military lobbyists. maybe that s because most politicians, but especially republicans, are more invested in personal careers and success than they are in their country.eight members of the senate voted against the bill: bernie sanders (i-vt), jeff merkley (d-or), bob corker (r-tn), kirsten gillibrand (d-ny), patrick leahy (d-vt), mike lee (r-ut), rand paul (r-ky), and ron wyden (d-or).featured image via win mcnamee/getty images',\n",
              " 'trump administration officials who were under pressure from the white house scrapped a study which found that refugees had brought in more government revenue overall than they had cost in benefits, the new york times reports. the trump administration has been unable to rationalize its move to reduce the number of refugees allowed into the united states next year, so it rejected a study by the department of health and human services which concluded that refugees brought in $63 billion more in government revenues over the past ten years than they cost.the new york times reports:the draft report, which was obtained by the new york times, contradicts a central argument made by advocates of deep cuts in refugee totals as president trump faces an oct. 1 deadline to decide on an allowable number. the issue has sparked intense debate within his administration as opponents of the program, led by mr. trump s chief policy adviser, stephen miller, assert that continuing to welcome refugees is too costly and raises concerns about terrorism.alt-right leader richard spencer has claimed that he was a mentor of stephen miller s and said that his mentee is a white nationalist. miller denied that affiliation with spencer, but his actions prove that he s an extremist.the study concluded that refugees  contributed an estimated $269.1 billion in revenues to all levels of government  between 2005 and 2014 via the payment of federal, state and local taxes.  overall, this report estimated that the net fiscal impact of refugees was positive over the 10-year period, at $63 billion. the white house claims that the study was politically motivated. this leak was delivered by someone with an ideological agenda, not someone looking at hard data,  a white house spokesman said.  the actual report pursuant to the presidential memorandum shows that refugees with few skills coming from war-torn countries take more government benefits from the department of health and human services than the average population, and are not a net benefit to the u.s. economy. according to two sources, miller personally intervened to ensure that only the costs   and not any fiscal benefit   of the program were considered, so it appears that he intentionally left out a few major details.trump has filled his administration with swamp-like creatures, including steve bannon, who once played a large role in the white house, and stephen miller who still occupies trump s ear.photo: alex wong via getty images.',\n",

              " 'after a terrorist attack in london, donald trump used the occasion to brag about himself and smear president obama.the united states has been fighting isis since 2014. most of that fighting has been done under the leadership of president obama.but nine months into his own presidency, trump is now declaring that he has done more against isis than president obama.we have made more progress in the last nine months against isis than the obama administration has made in 8 years.must be proactive & nasty!  donald j. trump (@realdonaldtrump) september 15, 2017but, as usual, trump is completely full of shit.under obama s strategy and leadership, the united states military killed over half of the commanders isis had and various military strikes wiped out well over 26,000 isis fighters (some reports say over 50,000), all while reducing isis  territory from a wide swath of the middle east stretching from syria through iraq to just a few remaining city strongholds.in addition, isis lost most of their valuable resources and recruitment dramatically declined.and in december 2016, united states officials announced that 75 percent of all isis fighters have been killed.by contrast, isis cheered when trump took office and have been using him as a recruitment tool. trump is also responsible for killing more civilians in nine months than president obama did in just over two years, which is just helping isis radicalize more fighters to their cause.basically, trump is waging a desperate destructive campaign to kill the remaining isis fighters and leaders so he can boast that he is  doing more  against isis. but his campaign is full of unnecessary collateral damage that is only helping isis recruit.in military parlance, trump s campaign is merely a  mop-up  operation, which is what takes place after the military has already gone in and wiped out most of the enemy forces.president obama s strategy and leadership resulted in isis being crippled. trump is only getting the crumbs that obama did not have time to finish off. and he can t even get that right because killing civilians is the best recruitment tool that terrorist organizations like isis and al-qaeda (another terrorist group president obama crippled) use to remain relevant.so trump can brag all he wants. it doesn t change the fact that president obama was a better commander-in-chief.featured image: jack gruber-pool/getty images',\n",

              " 'it has just come to light that stanislav petrov, a former soviet lieutenant colonel, passed away on may 19 this year in his apartment in the small town of fryazino, northeast of moscow. you have probably never heard of him, but if it weren t for petrov s actions (or lack thereof), there is a good chance you wouldn t be here to read this today.if you have seen the 2014 film the man who saved the world, staring kevin costner, then you might have some sort of an idea of who petrov is, as that movie was based how he prevented a nuclear crisis between the us and the ussr, as well as averting the potential for world war iii, back in the 1980s by essentially doing nothing at all. that could be a part of the reason petrov never considered himself a hero. at first when people started telling me that these tv reports had started calling me a hero, i was surprised. i never thought of myself as one   after all, i was literally just doing my job,  he once said in an interview later in life.the date was september 26, 1983 and petrov was on duty in a bunker near moscow, in charge of an early warning radar system. it wasn t long after midnight when petrov noticed a single missile on the screen, launched from the us and heading toward the soviet union. when i first saw the alert message, i got up from my chair. all my subordinates were confused, so i started shouting orders at them to avoid panic. i knew my decision would have a lot of consequences,  petrov recalled in a 2010 interview. the siren went off for a second time. giant blood-red letters appeared on our main screen, saying  start.  it said that four more missiles had been launched. this left the kremlin only 30 minutes from when the warheads were initially fired to decide whether retaliation with nuclear weapons of their own was necessary and petrov just 15 minutes to determine if the threat was indeed real. my cozy armchair felt like a red-hot frying pan and my legs went limp. i felt like i couldn t even stand up. that s how nervous i was when i was taking this decision. fortunately for all of mankind, petrov recalled from his training that, if the us were to attack, they would do so on an all-out offensive, as opposed to simply firing a couple of missiles here and there. petrov took this into account and declined to tell his superior officers, figuring that a system malfunction must be responsible for the alarm and it turned out he was right; the soviet satellites had actually picked up sunlight reflected from clouds and mistaken it for nuclear warheads, although petrov s decision to keep the information from his superiors was a severe infraction of soviet military rules.the incident was kept as a highly classified secret for years. even at the time of her death in 1997, petrov s own wife, raisa, wasn t aware of what he had done and it was only made public when colonel general yury votintsev, petrov s superintendent, decided in 1998 that his deed should be commended and told the story to bild, a german tabloid. german political activist karl schumacher was so affected by the article that he traveled to russia to find petrov and invited him back to germany in order to give his version  of how he had saved the world from nuclear war, something that had been a very real threat for decades.in 2006, the association of world citizens presented petrov with an award in the un headquarters in new york, which reads:  to the man who averted nuclear war.  in 2012, petrov was also honored with the german media prize, which has previously been awarded to nelson mandela, the dalai lama and kofi annan.stanislav petrov was 77 years old. watch the story of stanislav petrov s actions unfold here:',\n",

              " \"in a pair of tweets on thursday afternoon, donald trump proved once again how out of touch he is with the american public. just three months ago, pew research published a study showing that a substantial majority of americans   some 60 percent  feel the federal government is responsible for providing healthcare coverage for all citizens. not only that, but the formerly-controversial idea of a  single-payer  system, like the medicare for all bill just introduced with wide democratic support by senator bernie sanders, was favored by a third of americans.trump, however, sees universal coverage, enjoyed by every highly-developed nation in the world except the united states, as a  curse  on the citizens of this country.bernie sanders is pushing hard for a single payer healthcare plan   a curse on the u.s. & its people  donald j. trump (@realdonaldtrump) september 14, 2017 i told republicans to approve healthcare fast or this would happen. but don't worry, i will veto because i love our country & its people.  donald j. trump (@realdonaldtrump) september 14, 2017universal coverage was long considered a pipe dream, even as recently as during the primary campaign between hillary clinton and bernie sanders. secretary clinton dismissed it as an  idea that will never, ever come to pass.  but buoyed by the popularity of senator sanders after the disastrous win by donald trump in november, the democratic party has moved decidedly left on the issue.at the time of sanders  introduction of his bill, painted as the sane alternative to the republican frenzy to strip all americans of non-private health coverage, there were a number of democratic senators signed on, including those widely considered to be front-runners for the democratic nomination in 2020. cory booker, elizabeth warren, and even the favorites among clinton loyalists, kamala harris and kirsten gillibrand, all joined senator sanders in introducing medicare for all. they were joined by tammy baldwin, richard blumenthal, martin heinrich, mazie hirono, pat leahy, ed markey, jeff merkley, brian schatz, jeanne shaheen, tom udall, and sheldon whitehouse.the irony, of course, is that even if one considers universal coverage a  curse  as donald trump does, the bill stands essentially no chance of passage in the first place. trump would love to portray himself as a savior of conservative principles, but with republicans in firm control of congress (at least until 2018), the odds of trump even needing to look through his plethora of gold-plated pens to find the one for vetoes are slim to none.\",\n",

              " 'donald trump is the first authoritarian president we have ever had. of course, one of the hallmarks of autocrats is that they destabilize trust in the free press and eventually attempt to squash the fourth estate altogether. trump has done a remarkable job of implementing this dangerous autocratic strategy with his base. therefore, it is absolutely vital that news outlets make sure that everything they do is on the up and up. this is especially true of outlets that are favorite targets of trump s such as cnn.unfortunately, it seems that cnn is dropping the ball there in a major way. case in point   they had a white supremacist sit on a nationally televised panel about the debate over whether or not the deferred action for childhood arrivals program   otherwise known as daca   should be rescinded by the trump administration.on monday s edition of its early show, cnn had a panel discussion regarding the program that protects hundreds of thousands of undocumented immigrants who were brought here through no fault of their own by their parents and know no other home. on the panel were democratic strategist maria cordona, and dan stein of the foundation for american immigration reform (fair). however, there was one particularly disturbing detail that cnn left out of stein s introduction: that his organization has a long history of trafficking in white supremacy. luckily for the sake of public information, think progress s judd legum did it for them. legum writes: cnn did not mention fair s deep roots in white supremacy, eugenics, and white nationalism. the organization was founded by john tanton, who founded fair to keep america  a majority-white population. heidi beirich of the southern poverty law center says of the founder of fair: [tanton] has corresponded with holocaust deniers, former klan lawyers and the leading white nationalist thinkers of the era. he introduced key fair leaders to the president of the pioneer fund, a white supremacist group set up to encourage  race betterment,  at a 1997 meeting at a private club. he wrote a major funder to encourage her to read the work of a radical anti-semitic professor   to  give you a new understanding of the jewish outlook on life    and suggested that the entire fair board discuss the professor s theories on the jews. judd legum goes on to say that stein, said he believes america s immigration laws, which he regards as too permissive, are an effort  to retaliate against anglo-saxon dominance.  he said that the current generation of immigrants is engaged in  competitive breeding  and that  [m]any of them hate america, hate everything the united states stands for. as for stein s contributions to the cnn panel on monday morning? he insisted that daca is nothing more than arbitrary amnesty program,  and said that democrats should be forced to help the gop secure the borders, build the wall, interior enforcement and cut chain migration  if they want to protect the daca kids. in other words, make sure we keep america mostly white. no more brown people for this guy.now, cnn has some great anchors. they really do. personally, i try to tear myself away from msnbc in order to watch them sometimes   particularly outfront with erin burnett and the lead with jake tapper. that being said, i have never been comfortable with their penchant for allowing trump supporters to spew unchecked lies on the air. in this climate of deteriorating confidence in the fourth estate and confusion about what is and isn t true, these practices are hardly in the interest of the public good. now, they have white supremacists as panelists, somehow believing that these views should be given mainstream legitimacy.get your act together cnn. this is why i definitely prefer msnbc.watch this appalling discussion below:featured image via video screen capture',\n",
              " 'donald trump s decision to end the deferred action for childhood arrivals program (daca) is so toxic that even one of his most hardcore conservative republican supporters in the senate opposes it.it s safe to say that oklahoma senator james lankford is one of trump s most ardent supporters. after all, lankford votes with trump s position nearly 96 percent of the time, and he backed trump during the 2016 election.but lankford is breaking with trump when it comes to killing daca.daca was put in place by president obama to help children who were brought to the united states by their parents. america is where they grew up and it is the only home they have ever really known. daca was created to give them a path to citizenship and over 800,000 have applied.deporting these people is heartless, especially since they would be deported to countries they have never really lived in.trump s decision to end daca has been criticized by republicans and democrats alike, and has drawn outrage from the american people. trump s racist supporters, of course, support his decision.but some republicans, like lankford, oppose it. it is right for there to be consequences for those who intentionally entered this country illegally,  lankford said in a statement.  however, we as americans do not hold children legally accountable for the actions of their parents. we must confront the nation s out-of-date immigration policy and finally resolve the issues of strong border enforcement and merit immigration,  lankford continued.  policy reform must come from the american people through congress. the legislative and executive branch should put aside passivity and partisanship and finally modernize our immigration laws. that s nice, but if lankford really supports daca he will put his money where his mouth is and introduce a bill to enshrine it in law. anything less would reveal his statement to be a lie designed to save his own ass from the wrath of voters who oppose trump s decision.trump intends to make an official announcement on tuesday. let s hope the outrage and opposition are enough to make him change his mind.featured image via ron sachs   pool/getty images',\n",

              " \"when hurricane sandy hit, affecting states all the way from north carolina to new england and particularly devastating new york and new jersey in 2012, texas lawmakers overwhelmingly voted against recovery assistance. in fact, john culberson, whose 7th congressional district includes parts of houston, was the only texas republican in congress in favor of the $50.7 billion relief effort.one of the loudest opponents of sandy aid was ted cruz, who was merely weeks away from becoming a texas senator. cruz s main concerns involved additional spending, which included funding for disaster preparedness and relief in other parts of the country as a means of gaining support for the hurricane sandy relief effort. hurricane sandy inflicted devastating damage on the east coast, and congress appropriately responded with hurricane relief,  cruz said in a statement at the time in an effort to justify his stance. unfortunately, cynical politicians in washington could not resist loading up this relief bill with billions in new spending utterly unrelated to sandy. now cruz, who campaigned for president of the united states, eventually losing the republican primary in indiana to donald trump in march of last year, has teamed up with fellow texas senator john cornyn to contact president trump, begging him to sign a major disaster declaration at the request of texas governor greg abbott, allowing the state to access key federal resources as soon as possible. given the potential catastrophic impact that the hurricane may have on texas communities,  cruz and cornyn wrote in their plea to trump,  we strongly support this request and urge you to provide any and all emergency protective measures available by a major disaster declaration. the irony of cruz s appeal to the president hasn t been lost on residents on the east coast. msnbc even quizzed cruz yesterday on the hypocritical nature of his request, but in typical fashion, cruz just avoided the question. there s time for political sniping later,  he said.  i think our focus needs to be on this crisis and this disaster. despite cruz abandoning them in their time of need five years ago, several new york and new jersey lawmakers have decided to take the high road and support cruz during his.despite my tx colleagues refusal to support aid in #southjersey time of need, i will support emergency disaster $$ for those impacted  frank lobiondo (@replobiondo) august 28, 2017disasters & emergencies are just that disasters & emergencies. must stand together as americans, not be hypocritical based on geography  frank lobiondo (@replobiondo) august 28, 2017ted cruz & texas cohorts voted vs ny/nj aid after sandy but i'll vote 4 harvey aid. ny wont abandon texas. 1 bad turn doesnt deserve another  rep. pete king (@reppeteking) august 27, 2017as lifelong nyer w/ ny values i will vote for emergency harvey $ for ted cruz's constituents. above all, true americans must stand together.  rep. pete king (@reppeteking) august 27, 2017others were also quick to mention that maybe cruz should also pursue the funding for disaster preparation that he was so opposed to when sandy hit.texans should hope cruz helps do what he criticized the sandy aid package for doing: get $ for future texas storm prep. he won't, of course.  chris hooks (@cd_hooks) august 28, 2017featured image via michael reynolds   pool/getty images\",\n",

              " 'donald trump just threw a match on this tinder box of a nation when he decided to pardon former maricopa county, arizona sheriff joe arpaio. this guy is a racist who was convicted in court of contempt for refusing to follow an order to stop racially profiling and detaining people. arpaio terrorized that county for years with impunity and without consequence, and now it seems that he will be able to carry on being awful.now, there is even more nefarious news out there regarding this. it seems that trump tried to get jeff sessions  department of justice to let arpaio off the hook by dropping the case against him altogether. it seems that sessions told trump that such an action would not be the appropriate thing to do. having no other choice, trump waited until arpaio was convicted, and then decided to wait for the perfect time to issue a pardon. one white house official says of trump s thinking on the arpaio matter: we knew the president wanted to do this for some time now and had worked to prepare for whenever the moment may come. of course, we mustn t forget that arpaio and trump have been political partners in crime ever since they started the birtherism nonsense, in which they promoted the racist lie that president obama was not born in the united states. they both doggedly tried to prove that the nation s first black president was not a legitimate commander-in-chief   all because he s black.in short, they are two racist peas in a pod, so of course trump wasn t going to let his man go to jail, even though if there was ever someone who deserves to rot in jail, it s this racist, abusive former sheriff.one good thing came out of this, though: it showed that when trump is willing to do something truly egregious, the department of justice has maintained at least a little independence and is willing to push back. however, in this instance, said pushback had no real effect.come on, congress, mueller, whomever   please get rid of this lawless president while we still have a nation left.featured image via ralph freso/getty images',\n",

              " 'in house speaker paul ryan s ayn randish views, the way to fix the economy is by starving the poor to death. it s also totally going to help the poor   somehow. ryan, a catholic, was challenged by a nun during his first town hall in two years on monday evening. after angry constituents filled the room, sister erica jordan, a dominican nun and retired school principal took ryan s faith and his actions toward the poor to task. i know that you re a catholic, as am i. and it seems to me that most of the republicans in the congress are not willing to stand with the poor and working class, as evidenced in the recent debates about health care and the anticipated tax reform,  sister jordan said.  so i d like to ask how you see yourself upholding the church s social teaching that has the idea that god is always on the side of the poor and dispossessed, as should we be. in response, ryan said,  sister, you may   this may come as a surprise to you, but i completely agree with you. where we may disagree is on how to achieve that goal. as you know, we all exercise prudential judgment in practicing our faith. and for me, the preferential option for the poor, which is something that s a key tenet of the catholic faith, that means upward mobility, that means economic growth, that means equality of opportunity,  he continued.  that to me means working with this guy over here at gateway tech to make sure that we can close the skills gap, to make sure that every person who wants a career and job can get the benefits. except that ryan is wrong but at least he s consistent. republicans do not want to make higher education affordable so the  skills gap  claim doesn t hold water. the poor are being marginalized and misaligned, in many ways, because a lot of the programs that we have, well-intentioned as they may be, are discouraging and disincentivizing work,  he continued. i think we need to change our approach on fighting poverty,  he said without one bit of irony.  instead of measuring success on how much money we spend or how many programs we create or how many people on those programs, let s measure success and poverty on outcomes. watch:the budget produced by ryan s house of representatives would cut education and job training programs by 25 percent.math still matters, mr. ryan.featured image via screen capture',\n",
              " 'white supremacists have been emboldened by donald trump from the moment he came down the escalator in trump tower and announced his bid for the white house by branding all immigrants of mexican descent rapists and criminals. that travesty of a campaign continued in that vein, as has this sorry excuse of a  presidency.  trump knows that these people think they have a friend in him (and they do, honestly), so he refuses to disavow them.the latest debacle in that direction is, of course, trump s disgraceful equivocation between neo-nazis and their counter protesters during the violent white nationalist gathering in charlottesville, virginia. of course, that gathering claimed the life of heather heyer, a brave activist standing up against hate.after trump s remarks, former ku klux klan grand wizard david duke was alight with praise. it turns out there s a reason for that, and it is much more sinister than those of us who are not within the white power movement to really comprehend. there is one person who does, though: derek black, a former white nationalist and the son of don black, the founder of the infamous neo-nazi website stormfront.the younger black warns that trump s heightened flirtation with nazis and his legitimizing of their message via equivocation with counter protesters is really making things much worse. at first, the white nationalists  message wasn t getting out due to the news being focused on all of the violence. according to black, though, that all changed with trump. speaking to new york times writer michael barbaro, black said of trump s response to charlottesville: he salvaged their message. the message that they were trying to get out was that tearing down robert e lee s statue is an assault on white culture, so if you think that tearing down rel s statue is the wrong choice then these are your guys. but then amidst all the violence and the chaos, i think that got lost   you re not going to follow those people even if you believe that. but then in [trump s] message, saying these are good people because they re fighting for something that a lot of people believe in, he salvaged the message that they wanted to spread, which is that if you believe this too and maybe you re on the edge about whether this is a fringe movement or not, donald trump thinks we re fine. and that is just yet. it is why they are wearing khakis and polos now instead of hoods. it is why they are re-branding themselves the so-called  alt-right.  it is why they are even telling people who come to their rallies to look  sexy    so that they can disassociate from uneducated, mouthbreathing rednecks who everyone mocks and no one takes seriously. they want to make sure this is someone who could be your cookie cutter suburban family, just living next door, and you d be none the wiser. that s why it is so important to keep this a fringe group in the minds of everyone, regardless of whether their politics are left-wing or right-wing. black further explains: it s just impossible to say what will happen in the future. maybe nothing. but the point of that rally was to try to recruit people, to try to grow. and if you were on the fence about whether you should get involved in that stuff or not, the president s ok is the biggest thing that s ever happened. that s why what trump is doing here is so dangerous. it s why we all need to make sure that white supremacy, no matter how it is dressed up, is never normalized. ever. that will be the job of all of us, because clearly, that messaging will never come from the white house.thank you, derek black, for denouncing your family s hateful beliefs, and speaking out in a unique way to counter this kind of hate.featured image via twitter',\n",

              " 'it seems like a lifetime since march 23rd, 2010. but thanks to a pretty significant bill signed that day, at least there are no lifetime caps on your health insurance anymore. in fact, there were so many rules and regulations inside obamacare that benefited consumers instead of insurers that the gop went absolutely insane trying to undo them. that s no small wonder: insurance companies gave republican candidates and conservative groups nearly 37 million dollars in the last election cycle of 2015-16 alone.but the one thing obamacare didn t do  couldn t do   was clamp down on premiums. not without changing the way the entire industry is regulated. the fact is, premiums have been skyrocketing for a long time, and for a simple reason. insurance companies know you need them more than they need you. in other words, because they can. but an interesting thing happened after the aca was signed: the rising cost of premiums slowed to less than half the growth rate they were undergoing during the bush years. why? because more people were getting insured.republicans point to raw numbers and call it an increase that happened under obama. but the premium increase from 2010 to 2016 was much, much smaller than it would have been without the changes to the system that obamacare wrought. what will they point to now that premiums are on a fast track again? they won t point to republican policy or donald trump. but i will.the kaiser family foundation, a non-partisan, non-profit health care think tank, has been studying premium growth for nearly 20 years. in fact, if you ve ever read stats on health care   who s insured, median cost, what might happen if various bills were passed   you were likely looking at kff data. and according to their latest study, there s a definitive reason that premiums are going up at the rate they re back to: because donald trump is sabotaging the aca.trump s constant description of obamacare as  failing  is already unhelpful. but his threats to stop cost-sharing subsidy payments are worse. and even worse than that, his persistent badgering of the gop congress to repeal obamacare entirely   even without a replacement plan   has insurance companies scrambling to figure out how to stay in business. if donald trump got his way, after all, the number of people without health insurance in america would double in a very short time. and if you don t have insurance, they don t have a customer.so what s the effect of trump s sabotage? premiums are about to go through the roof. just by threatening to stop enforcing the individual mandate   the mechanism that makes obamacare even work   trump has caused insurers to request rate increases from regulators anywhere from 1.2 percent to 20 percent. and his threats to stop cost-sharing payments bumps that startling figure up to 23 percent.for years, republicans liked to point to any increase in premiums as the fault of obamacare. but premium growth slowed as america got used to the idea of a larger risk pool, and it hasn t started under obama in the first place. now we can point directly to the actions of donald trump as the reason premiums are once again on the rise.featured image via joe raedle/getty images',\n",

              " 'there are no two crazy people ever mentioned more in the news than the leaders of west and east, donald trump and kim jong-un. for the citizens of america and north korea, unfortunately, no two crazy leaders are more alike. from out-of-control hair to ludicrous proclamations, trump and kim are like brothers from another (deeply disturbed) mother.we thought we d take a look at some of the ways the two are alike, starting with what we ve already mentioned kim jong-un was the undisputed world champion of insanity until right around the middle of trump s run at the presidency here in the united states. how could anyone compete with kim s reclamation of one half hour from the japanese on august 15, 2015, 96 years after the korean dignitary says japan  stole time  from north korea? it s hard to keep up with a man who learned to drive at only age three.trump does his best, though. on day one of his presidency, he insisted that it stopped raining just as he began to give his inaugural address   which was news to those in attendance getting wet as it began raining at precisely that moment. that same day, donald looked out at a crowd roughly half the size of the previous inauguration to take place and declared it  the biggest crowd at any inauguration, ever. kim is famous for using doctored video to fake missile launches, a  show  of his military prowess and resolve. trump prefers to lie the old-fashioned way: by just making shit up and hoping nobody calls him on it. we don t actually have room here for a more complete documentation of all of the outright lies from either toddler tyrant, but rest assured that the lists are extensive. although their rallies look slightly different:uniforms, flowers, and colorful dresses line the streets of north ko-razy (pool/getty)fans display a makeshift sign made of used beer cases (justin merriman/getty)in july, upon release of the hwasong 14 missile, kim (who is literally never seen out of uniform) reportedly  expressed satisfaction, saying it looked as handsome as a good-looking boy and was well made. just one month earlier, trump was waxing romantic about his own terrible toys, pitching the sale of  beautiful military equipment because nobody makes it like the united states  while he was in the middle east. there was no uniform for trump that day, but only because he wasn t on an aircraft carrier.remember that time kim jong-un said,  it would be perfect for obama to live with a group of monkeys in the world s largest african natural zoo and lick the breadcrumbs thrown by spectators  through the korean central news agency?i d pretty much put an equals sign between that and the time trump told the former president of trump plaza hotel & casino that  laziness is a trait in blacks. frankly, that s gross, so i m not going to spend a whole lot of time on this entry, other than to say that trump s  you can do anything  looks exactly the same to me as kim s  pleasure squad. so this one s kind of misleading: kim jong-un inherited a state media from his dad. they pretty much just say whatever he tells them to say, and he has the final word on whether anything anyone in his country ever says makes it into print. there is no internet for regular citizens in north korea.trump, on the other hand, is trying to get there by delegitimizing our constitutionally-protected press and supporting television programming that serves as propaganda.maybe you ve heard of some of north korea s brutal executions for  crimes  as petty as falling asleep during an event. but do you remember that time donald trump took out full-page ads in every paper in new york calling for the execution of the  central park five,  a group of teenage boys who were coerced into confessing to a rape they didn t commit? they were completely exonerated by dna evidence, and reimbursed $41 million by the state for their ordeal. trump reiterated his belief that the boys (then men) were guilty as recently as 2016.  what were they doing in the park, playing checkers?  he tweeted a few years back. to recap the last four horrid sentences: trump wanted the death penalty for a non-capital crime that the people didn t commit.how could i forget this one? although we don t know the extent of kim jong-un s corruption, we can make a pretty educated guess, based on the fact that like his father before him, he lives like a king while the citizens of north korea literally eat sawdust to keep from starving.trump s corruption, however, can be more accurately tracked because there are websites dedicated to chronicling it all. i would hate to see the internet run out of available pages, though, so hopefully we get rid of this guy soon. in fact, he never should have been president in the first place, because like all fascists the kim family, of course, has always been in power in the secretive kingdom. but that doesn t stop them from  electing  their leaders   who run unopposed, of course.trump s dark ties to russia, however, may prove to be the end of his presidency. for all the indignity we ve suffered in even allowing donald trump to assume the presidency of the united states, we at least still have a constitution and some semblance of democracy. and we have something north koreans don t: bob muller and a grand jury.i m sure you could comment on this with more examples of similarities between the two supreme leaders. in fact, feel free! but bookmark the page for when you get into arguments on the internet   there are a lot of useful links in this article. in fact, forward this thing to your right-wing uncle, and tell him to click everything he sees.it can t possibly hurt him to know his favorite politician is basically a crazy asian dictator.read more:featured image via wikimedia commons',\n",

              " 'you almost have to feel sorry for republicans (almost). they find themselves between a really unpopular president and a party that only rewards those who are perfectly loyal to dear orange leader.ronna romney mcdaniel, the current head of the republican national committee and niece of the last republican presidential loser, mitt romney, says that not supporting donald trump should be a cautionary tale for any republican that ever hopes to win another election.on cnn s laura ingraham show, mcdaniel tried to pretend that the rnc stays out of primaries, but that gop sen. jeff flake was sure to lose because, unlike the toy brown-shirted robots in congress, he refused to march (at least on paper) to trump s xenophobic (and generally everything phobic) message.flake wrote a book called  conscience of a conservative: a rejection of destructive politics and a return to principle,  a title he only partly stole from barry goldwater.flake dared take on trump and his own party, saying that trump is a symptom of a dying party. but make no mistake, as a governing philosophy, conservatism is indeed in crisis   and not in spite of this apparent success but because of it,  later blasting self-described conservatives for changing their political stripes  depending on fashion or the passions of the day or based on how much applause a line in a speech received at a rally. we have given in to the politics of anger   the belief that riling up the base can make up for failed attempts to broaden the electorate,  flake writes.  these are the spasms of a dying party. source: nprnow the party is pissed. mcdaniel fell short of threatening flake, but the implication was clear as day   if republicans don t support trump, they will likely lose. they need to have another candidate that they supported and the three rnc members that have to agree on that other candidate for rule 11 to apply, but it is in their bylaws,  mcdaniel said.  it s just interesting from a party standpoint, we do have governance. we have 168 members that they make those decisions. sometimes you get in the nitty gritty, but i will say if you look at 2016, the senators that did not support the president, and let s look at joe heck and kelly ayotte, they fell short in those senate races, so there is a cautionary tale there because voters want you to support the president in his agenda. source: cnnwe should note that flake votes with trump 93.5 percent of the time. i guess his conscience is that of a man who wants to sell books.mcdaniel, of course, neglects to mention that during the election, trump s approval ratings were sort of close to 50 percent. now, he s below 40 percent. between his inability to negotiate deals of any kind and his efforts to take health insurance away from his own base, people are beginning to turn on him. it s not the same political climate as it was just a few months ago, so seeing the 2016 election as a cautionary tale for anything (other than letting russians interfere) is pretty much moot.what this does say, though, is that republicans aren t going to be turning on trump anytime soon and that impeachment will be an uphill battle, at least if they want the support of their party, which of course, is more important than their country.featured image via mark wilson/getty images',\n",

              " 'donald trump has successfully torn the republican party (and america) apart. his policies have not only divided americans across the country, but even members of his own party are at odds with their president s policies.one thing that is shattering the gop is the growing opposition to trump s immigration agenda. during trump s campaign and budding presidency, trump was touting a border wall and mass deportations. now that trump has announced somewhat more concrete plans, some high profile republicans are publicly voicing their disappointment.one of the most outspoken gopers going up against trump is south carolina senator lindsey graham, who is warning trump that his merit-based immigration plan would be a  disaster  for states like south carolina. graham said in a statement: after dealing with this issue for more than a decade, i know that when you restrict legal labor to employers it incentivizes cheating. here s trump announcing his merit-based system, called the raise act:i campaigned on creating a merit-based immigration system that protects u.s. workers & taxpayers. watch: https://t.co/lv3scsknf6 #raiseact pic.twitter.com/zcfk5ofynb  donald j. trump (@realdonaldtrump) august 2, 2017since trump announced the raise act on tuesday, it has been opposed by several democratic lawmakers and several republicans like graham. these lawmakers are arguing that trump s proposed plan puts the service industry  in peril.  graham explained: south carolina s number one industry is agriculture and tourism is number two. if this proposal were to become law, it would be devastating to our state s economy which relies on this immigrant workforce. south carolina s agriculture and tourism industry advertise for american workers and want to fill open positions with american workers. unfortunately, many of these advertised positions go unfilled. hotels, restaurants, golf courses and farmers will tell you this proposal to cut legal immigration in half would put their business in peril. another south carolina republican, tim scott, also opposed trump s plans. scott stated that america needed to fix  our broken illegal immigration problem  but also wanted the country  to encourage the legal process  due to its positive effects on the labor force. senate republican conference chairman john thune had similar concerns about the labor workforce. he said: if we get on immigration, there will be a lot of different perspectives on that  we have workforce needs, and some of those are filled by the immigrant labor supply. unfortunately, this is likely going to fall on deaf ears, considering that the current potus was ignorant enough to say in his campaign announcement, when mexico sends its people, they aren t sending their best.  trump has been anti-immigration from the start, and he clearly doesn t care if the way he goes about it sucks.featured image is a screenshot',\n",

              " 'donald trump finally signed the countering america s adversaries through sanctions act on wednesday.  this bill strengthens and expands sanctions on russia, iran, and north korea. the legislation also blocks trump from easing those sanctions for his good buddy vladimir putin.some questioned if trump would try to use his veto power even though the bill had passed both the house and senate with overwhelming support. such an effort would have been futile, as there was clearly enough support to override the veto. but still, it was a possibility since nothing is ever off the table with this administration. and as time drug on (the bill landed on trump s desk friday morning), we all began to wonder if trump was actually going to sign it.when he finally did, senator john mccain had a brutal response that was absolutely perfect. he started by explaining what this legislation would accomplish. i welcome president trump s decision to sign legislation imposing new sanctions on russia, iran, and north korea. the enactment of this legislation, which enjoyed overwhelming bipartisan support in both houses of congress, sends a strong message to friend and foe alike that the united states will hold nations accountable for aggressive and destabilizing behavior that threatens our national interests and those of our allies and partners,  mccain wrote. the concerns expressed in the president s signing statement are hardly surprising, though misplaced. the framers of our constitution made the congress and the president coequal branches of government. this bill has already proven the wisdom of that choice. then mccain called trump out for his continued hypocritical support of russia. while the american people surely hope for better relations with russia, what this legislation truly represents is their insistence that vladimir putin and his regime must pay a real price for attacking our democracy, violating human rights, occupying crimea, and destabilizing ukraine. on this critical issue of national security policy, it was the congress that acted in the spirit of national unity to carry out the will of the american people. and that is why it is critical that the president comply with the letter and spirit of this legislation and fully implement all of its provisions. going forward, i hope the president will be as vocal about russia s aggressive behavior as he was about his concerns with this legislation. boom!sorry mccain, but i wouldn t count on trump to stand up to putin any time soon. our  president  has proven time and time again that he will happily choose russia over the united states and the american people. trump s admiration for the russian dictator and his murderous rule is as obvious as it is nauseating. personally, i don t think that is likely to change. trump is in so deep with putin that he couldn t get out even if he wanted to.featured image via chip somodevilla/getty images',\n",

(insert eye roll here.)now trump thinks that maybe the person he needs as his communications director is his good old adviser and former campaign manager, conway. she has proven time and time again that she is loyal to trump   and that she has no problem lying to the press about anything and everything. this also happens to be the reason that she has absolutely no credibility.way back in february, morning joe s mika brzenski said that she refused to have conway appear on the show because she is the epitome of  fake news. so, joe was just saying that she books herself on these shows. we know for a fact she tries to book herself on this show. i won t do it because i don t believe in fake news or information that is not true. everytime i ve ever seen her on television something s askew, off, or incorrect,  brzenski said on-air.and this is who the white house thinks should be their number one spokesperson? seriously? the fact that she is even being considered is enough to let you know that these people are a few flakes short of a full bowl of cornflakes. but with trump in the oval office one thing is for sure, just when you think things can t get any more absurd, they do.featured image via mark wilson/getty images',\n",

              " 'one of the things that has plagued america   besides donald trump himself   is the potus  twitter usage. every day, trump s twitter account serves as an endless amount of humiliation and chaos for a country that was once well-respected around the world. while trump has proven to his staff (and the country) that he cannot be controlled on social media, a federal court may have just ruled that there are some things he just cannot do on twitter.one of trump s most disturbing behaviors lies in his tendency to block people on twitter just because they disagree with him. currently, trump is being sued by the knight first amendment institute at columbia university for blocking people just because they expressed criticism. thanks to a federal court ruling that happened this week, trump may not be able to do that anymore.this week, a federal court ruled on a case very similar to trump s, in which the chair of the loudoun county board of supervisors, phyllis j. randall, had been blocking constituents on her public facebook page. in the case davison v. loudoun county board of supervisors, randall wrote on her county facebook page, i really want to hear from any loudoun citizen on any issues, request, criticism, compliment, or just your thoughts.  when brian c. davidson took her up on her offer, bringing up the alleged corruption in the county s school board, randall responded by deleting his comment and blocking him. the following morning, randall unblocked davidson but he was not able to comment on her page or send her messages. davidson argued that this was a violation of his freedom of speech, and a federal court ruled in his favor.u.s. district judge james c. cacheris ruled that this was a violation of the first amendment s free speech clause because randall was  offended by his criticism of her colleagues in the county government , which he regarded as unconstitutional  viewpoint discrimination    pretty much what trump does on twitter. cacheris explained:defendant s offense at plaintiff s views was therefore an illegitimate basis for her actions particularly given that plaintiff earned defendant s ire by criticizing the county government. indeed, the suppression of critical commentary regarding elected officials is the quintessential form of viewpoint discrimination against which the first amendment guards. by prohibiting plaintiff from participating in her online forum because she took offense at his claim that her colleagues in the county government had acted unethically, defendant committed a cardinal sin under the first amendment.this certainly has implications to what might happen with trump s own twitter account. while trump might try to argue that his personal twitter page   separate from the @potus presidential account   is not intended to function as a public forum, it s obvious that trump uses it to make presidential announcements. members of his own team, such as former white house press secretary sean spicer, have even stated that trump s tweets are  official statements    which means this account should be subjected to the same rules as randall s public facebook page was.featured image via steve pope / getty images',\n",

              " 'according to lawyers for donald trump, it was completely fine for the now president to have encouraged supporters to use  reasonable force  to remove disruptive protestors from his campaign rallies last year, as he was just exercising his right to freedom of speech by doing so.the claim came during an emergency motion asking the us appeals court to throw out a lawsuit filed by three people who believe they were manhandled at a trump rally that took place during march last year in louisville, ky. fortunately for the two women and one man, u.s. district judge david hale refused to dismiss the case, stating that the plaintiffs  lawsuit  described a chaotic and violent scene in which a crowd of people turned on three individuals,  with the plaintiffs being punched, kicked and verbally abused. according to trumps lawyers, one of the plaintiffs, an african american woman, had held up a  sign depicting trump s face on the body of pig, trump kept saying,  get them out, get them out,  and people in the crowd began pushing and shoving the protesters,  said alvin bamberger, one of the audience members at the rally who was cited in the lawsuit and the one whom the plaintiffs described as the  most aggressive.  the president s lawyers felt the need to add that, in trump s defence, he did say at the time,  don t hurt  em. if i say,  go get  em,  i get in trouble with the press, the most dishonest human beings in the world. the plaintiffs are attempting to sue trump and his campaign, but the real question here is whether trump should be deemed responsible for having incited, or at the very least, provoked the violence in the first place. the three people beaten and abused at the louisville rally do, hence the reason why they re seeking damages from the president for what they believe was a reckless incitement of violence.president trump s lawyers claim in their latest motion that protesters who  initially purchased tickets and entered the rally in a peaceful manner  can also be forcibly removed if they become disruptive. it also makes no difference whether the crowd reacted with unlawful violence beyond what mr. trump advocated, because the hostile reaction of the crowd does not not transform protected speech into incitement,  the lawyers added in their statement.judge hale believes the plaintiffs  complaint is more than enough to proceed toward a trial, writing in his march 31 order it is plausible that trump s directive to  get  em out of here  advocated the use of force. [it] is stated in the imperative; it was an order, an instruction, a command. trump s lawyers, however, believe that, not only is that a reasonable order for trump to give, it is also his right. without this court s intervention, this litigation will inflict irreparable harm on the trump defendants by subjecting them to punitive litigation as the price of exercising their core first amendment rights,  washington attorney michael carvin said wrote. mr. trump had a first amendment right to call for the removal of disruptive protesters from his campaign rally, and it is a bedrock principle of law that the right to exclude another   includes the right to use reasonable force. furthermore, trump s lawyers filed a  writ of mandamus  with the u.s. 6th circuit court this week, asking the appeals court to remove the case from hale. their argument was that trump cannot be held liable for  negligently inspiring third parties to engage in violence. featured image via justin merriman/getty images',\n",

              " 'if donald trump thinks being president means he can t be prosecuted for his crimes, he should think again.as it turns out, special prosecutor robert mueller has the power to indict trump if he has enough evidence proving that trump committed a criminal act such as colluding with russia in an effort to win the 2016 election. donald trump s son trump jr. has already demonstrated that trump s campaign met with a kremlin-linked russian lawyer and a former soviet intelligence officer in order to get dirt to use against hillary clinton, which is, indeed, the very definition of collusion.mueller s power to indict is confirmed by a 56-page legal memo written by ronald rotunda, a conservative professor of constitutional law and ethics, who was hired as part of special prosecutor kenneth starr s team during the bill clinton presidency.according to the 1998 memo, which was obtained by the new york times,it is proper, constitutional, and legal for a federal grand jury to indict a sitting president for serious criminal acts that are not part of, and are contrary to, the president s official duties. in this country, no one, even president clinton, is above the law.that means no sitting president is above the law, including trump.watergate special counsel, leon jaworski, came to the same conclusion in 1974.the only reason why jaworski and starr declined to indict president nixon and president clinton is because they chose to let impeachment proceedings play out instead.well, republicans have thus far done everything they can to protect trump from being impeached. so it appears mueller may not have a choice but to indict trump if republicans continue to refuse to do their public duty.even the supreme court has ruled that sitting presidents are not above the law by deciding in 1997 that a lawsuit against clinton for misconduct prior to becoming president can move forward. and since trump was not president when he and his campaign colluded with russia, that makes his misconduct open to indictment, along with any other crimes he committed prior to taking office. that means if mueller digs through trump s finances and finds other crimes, trump could face an indictment for those as well. if there is no recourse against the president, if he cannot be prosecuted for violating the criminal laws, he will be above the law,  rotunda further wrote. if public policy and the constitution allow a private litigant to sue a sitting president for acts that are not part of the president s official duties (and are outside the outer perimeter of those duties), and that is what clinton v. jones squarely held, then one would think that an indictment is constitutional because the public interest in criminal cases is greater. in short, trump is in deep shit and he can t blame hillary clinton to get out of it. not even republicans can dispute the starr memo. republicans not only supported starr s investigation, it was a conservative legal mind who wrote the memo.so unless republicans proceed with impeachment proceedings to get to the bottom of this once and for all, robert mueller must indict trump. because it is clear that republicans won t punish trump for breaking the law and violating the constitution.featured image: addicting info archive',\n",

[emphasis mine]so devin nunes lied? it certainly looks like that s what burr is saying. while burr acknowledged that american citizens on trump s transition team were unmasked, and that information did become public when it shouldn t have, he seems to believe that nunes was making things up when he accused susan rice of improper unmasking.that goes with earlier reports that nunes got his information from the white house, which has had a bone to pick with the entire obama administration since jan. 20. nunes was vague in discussing the unmasking, apparently because the information was classified (but maybe also because he knew he was lying).most other lawmakers who have seen these records, and have seen the unmasking, said there was no evidence of wrongdoing on rice s part, or anyone else s. but nunes made it his mission to discredit rice (and thus, obama) to the point where he could at least accuse the obama administration of breaking the law.the problem with nunes  involvement with this investigation is that he was always more interested in clearing trump than he was in actually investigating the fact that a hostile foreign power successfully meddled in our election in 2016. he s also apparently said that he s been getting updates on the investigation despite recusing himself from it, and that he  can do whatever i want. i m the chairman of the committee. nunes needs to lose his job.featured image via mark wilson/getty images',\n",

( when is donald trump going to stop embarrassing his friends, let alone the whole country?  murdoch senior tweeted the day after trump officially declared himself a candidate.) murdoch instructed ailes to tilt to anyone but trump, ailes confided to me before he was fired, even hillary. (ailes, for his part, characterized murdoch s periodic efforts at interference as similar to nixon s instructions to bomb this or that country   best ignored.)wolff s report also reveals that after trump s surprise win on election night, murdoch had no choice but to fall in line and kiss trump s a**.after the election, a confounded murdoch had to call on his ex-wife wendi s friends, ivanka trump and jared kushner, to broker a rapprochement with the disreputable donald. now, to trump s great satisfaction, a humbled murdoch is a constant caller.republicans have all done the same as murdoch. even those  never trumpers  who openly opposed him throughout his campaign have all silently accepted their fate since his win. and it seems that no matter what he does now, even cozying up to putin as the russia scandal continues to heat up, conservatives still can t seem to find the guts to kick his orange derriere out of the white house.featured image via justin sullivan/getty images',\n",

              " 'how the hell can anybody call themselves intelligent when they re supporting donald trump? it s a question that baffles people who are able to think critically, able to read and comprehend both history and current events, and able to see through trump s thin fa ade of know-it-all-ism and deep into what he is   an ignorant, narcissistic, and dangerous conman.trump supporters not only don t see this, they re happy that there s someone running for president that thinks exactly like them. take melanie austin, of brownsville, pennsylvania. she thought her beliefs about obama being a gay muslim from kenya and michelle being transgender were just fringe beliefs   right up until she started hearing similar stuff from trump and other right-wing extremists.now she knows she s right about all of this. you can t tell her that she s ignorant and dumb if she can t figure this out for herself. you can t tell her she s delusional. you can sit there with her, and countless others like her, and present facts, figures, charts, studies, and more, all from the most reputable sources there are, and prove that her lord and savior is wrong, and you ll still get shot down.there s more to this than the problem of confirmation bias. austin gets much of her information from fringe right-wing blogs and conspiracy sites, but that s not all of it. many of trump s supporters are seriously too dumb to know they re dumb. it s called the dunning-kruger effect, and it s an unshakeable illusion that you re much smarter, and more skilled and/or knowledgeable, than you really are.people like austin labor under the illusion that their knowledge about things is at least as good as, if not better than, the actual facts. for these people, though, their knowledge isn t just superior   it s superior even to those who have intimate and detailed knowledge of the subject at hand. trump himself has exemplified this countless times, such as when he claimed he knows more about isis than even our military generals do.his fans simply take his word for it, and believe that because he knows, they know. they are literally incapable of seeing that they don t know.to be sure, the dunning-kruger effect is present everyone all across the political spectrum, and indeed, in every walk of life. we all overestimate our abilities and knowledge somewhere. however, the effect is especially pronounced in people with limited intellectual and social skills: [p]eople who are unskilled in [intellectual and social domains] suffer a dual burden: not only do these people reach erroneous conclusions and make unfortunate choices, but their incompetence robs them of the metacognitive ability to realize it. so basically, yes, it s possible to be too dumb to realize you re dumb.in four separate studies, people who scored in the bottom quarter on tests involving everything from humor to logic, and even to grammar, grossly overestimated where they thought they would score. they averaged scores in the 12th percentile, while their average estimate of their own scores was the 62nd percentile.the researchers attribute that huge discrepancy to a literal inability to distinguish accuracy from error. or, to put it another way, those who are the most lacking in skills and knowledge are the least able to see it.take the case of mcarthur wheeler, a man who robbed two banks in 1995 and was caught rather easily. he thought he would get away with it because he rubbed his face with lemon juice, which is used in invisible ink. to test the theory that lemon juice would turn him invisible, he rubbed it on his face, took a polaroid, and his face wasn t in the picture! so he thought he was safe from security cameras because he could make his face invisible.he was shocked when police caught him because of that, saying,  but i wore the juice.  he literally couldn t see the ridiculousness of that line of thought. david dunning, one of the first to catalog the dunning-kruger effect (hence its name), has studied human behavior including voter behavior for decades. he penned an op-ed in politico that explains why this effect is so pronounced in trump s supporters: it suggests that some voters, especially those facing significant distress in their life, might like some of what they hear from trump, but they do not know enough to hold him accountable for the serious gaffes he makes. they fail to recognize those gaffes as missteps.  again, the key to the dunning-kruger effect is not that unknowledgeable voters are uninformed; it is that they are often misinformed their heads filled with false data, facts and theories that can lead to misguided conclusions held with tenacious confidence and extreme partisanship, perhaps some that make them nod in agreement with trump at his rallies. trump is completely inept, and his supporters are way too poorly-informed to know that he s inept, and too dumb themselves to know how dumb they are. that s why trump s supporters are so sure they re smart and their president is smart that they won t listen to reason. the effect is strong in these people.featured image by mark wilson/getty images',\n",

              " 'keeping in line with his constant backtracking and just generally erratic ways, president donald trump has taken a softer stance on what was seen as essentially his core campaign promise by claiming that the 2,000 mile long wall he initially intended to build along the border with mexico may not need to cover the full distance due to natural borders that already exist. you have mountains. you have some rivers that are violent and vicious. you have some areas that are so far away that you don t really have people crossing,  the president told reporters aboard air force one on his recent flight to paris.  but you ll need anywhere from 700 to 900 miles. trump made the construction of a big beautiful wall, with a big beautiful door,  a solid structure 30 feet high in an effort to curb illegal immigration the cornerstone of his 2016 election campaign, insisting that mexico would pay for it with the cost estimated to be in the vicinity of $20 billion, although he later stated that could be cut by covering the wall in solar panels. naturally mexico has refused to pay, most likely because they never requested the border wall in the first place, however, trump still believes he will find a way to get them to cough up the cash after construction begins.but if you believe that the president s insistence that mexico will reimburse the us for construction for the wall is the only flaw in his plan, you are sadly mistaken. first of all, almost all of that  700 to 900 miles  that trump mentioned, less than half of the length of the us-mexico border, already has walls and fences. in fact, the current border wall is already 650 miles long. also, as for the rivers that are  violent and vicious,  yes a large part of the border in texas consists of the rio grande, but some parts of that river are barely more than a trickle of water.president trump also now believes the border wall needs to be transparent. you have to be able to see through it,  he said.  as horrible as it sounds, when they throw the large sacks of drugs over, and if you have people on the other side of the wall, you don t see them. they hit you on the head with 60 pounds of stuff? it s over. we re now six months into his presidency and trump has only requested $1.6 billion from congress for the project, or roughly 8 percent of the total estimate. maybe he has just learned that according to pew research center, approximately 66 percent of the illegal immigrants in the us have been here for at least a decade, that the amount of illegal mexican immigrants has been in decline for the last 10 years and is now one million less than it was in 2007, or that mexicans only make up 52 percent of illegal immigrants in the united states.featured image via sandy huffaker/getty images',\n",

              " 'since donald trump s november 8 election victory, there has been a significant rise in hate-based threats and attacks in the united states, with the southern poverty law center (splc) documenting 1,863 such incidents between then and april, at least 330 of which took place on college campuses. in fact, in the 10 days following the election, there was an average of 87 incidents per day!at the peak of these occurrences immediately following the election, there was a 500 percent spike in bias-based incidents when compared to daily hate crimes reported by the fbi for all of 2015. to be completely honest, these types of incidents have decreased slightly in recent months, but the most troubling part of this whole situation is the increase in the severity of the attacks.what makes these incidents even more frightening is the sheer amount that occur on college campuses, thanks mostly to an upsurge in white supremacists campaigning and recruiting in american colleges. it is getting so bad that the splc has documented more than 135 incidents of white supremacist and nationalist recruitment efforts on us campuses since the commencement of the 2016 academic year. it s a definite uptick, and they ve been making a concerted effort to flyer and paper as many campuses as they possibly can,  says lecia brooks, the splc s outreach director, adding that the campaigning has notably increased since trump s presidential victory. it shouldn t be hidden,  brooks said in reference to incidents documented at schools across the entire country.  the [university] administrations should always issue a strong statement of condemnation clearly stating who they [white supremacist groups] are and what they represent, encouraging students to disregard their recruitment [drives] and disavow their message. the result of these recruitment efforts is a huge escalation in hate-based incidents on college campuses, including tommy curry, an african-american philosophy professor at texas a&m university, constantly receiving death threats via email and voice messages, the stabbing death of richard w collins, an african-american bowie state university student, while visiting the university of maryland and the election of taylor dumpson, american university in washington dc s first african-american, female student-government president, being met with nooses tied around the campus with bananas labeled  harambe bait.  and those are only the tip of the iceberg. i think the most threatening part is that we re beginning to see this rise up again because people feel comfortable and they feel empowered to have these kinds of beliefs, and that s terrifying,  dumpson said.featured image via scott olson/getty images',\n",

              " 'during his presidential campaign, donald trump constantly made references to repealing and replacing  the disaster that is obamacare  and democrats collectively shuddered. we all knew that nothing good could come of this.now after six months in office, despite discovering that nobody knew healthcare could be so difficult, president trump is about to deliver on his campaign promise as the senate returns from a one-week recess to get back to the task at hand; trying to come to an agreement on their new healthcare bill known as the better care reconciliation act (bcra), one that they have predominately kept the public in the dark about.things are looking bleak, however, as even the republican party remains divided on a bill that is not only going to raise out-of-pocket costs and restrict access to services for many, but also cause tens of millions to lose their health insurance completely over the coming decade.these charts might be able to put the entire healthcare debacle into perspective:1. we all know the short-term medicaid cuts are going to suck: the new health care bill will save a ton of money, but roughly a quarter of those savings, or approximately $770 billion over the next decade, come from cuts to medicaid. the result is that 15 million less people will be enrolled in medicaid under the new gop bill than compared to obamacare:2. if you thought that was bad, the long-term effects are even worse: the inflation rate for medicaid spending beginning in 2025 is much slower, affecting those who rely on it the most, mainly children, the disabled, and the elderly. in fact, by 2036 federal medicaid spending on children will be reduced by almost a third and by a quarter for the disabled and the elderly when compared to the current law according to an analysis by the health consulting firm avalere health:3. the percentage of those uninsured will rise in every single age bracket: that s right, under the bcra 22 million people will lose their insurance (compared to 23 million under the version passed by the house) and every single age group will be affected, according to an assessment by the congressional budget office:4. it will also rise in every state, including those whose overwhelming majority voted for trump: yes, the new bill will drive up the uninsured rate by at least 21% and even up to 300% in every state by 2022, a new study by the urban institute found:5. the older and poorer you are, the more you will be paying for insurance premiums if an analysis by the center for budget and policy priorities is to be believed, health insurance premiums are going to go through the roof, but those hit the worst will be older americans:6. the older middle class will be hit pretty hard too, as their tax credits will go through the floor: the center for budget and policy priorities  analysis also found that the tax credits that are available to help older people in the individual market afford health insurance are going to do just the opposite and plummet:7. even employer plans aren t immune: the gop s new bill cuts to medicaid and individual market subsidies have given the 150 million americans that receive their health insurance through their employer a false sense of security, but they re not safe, either. not only will the new legislation bring back annual and lifetime limits in employer plans, as well as end penalties for companies that don t provide health insurance to their workers, but it will also allow employers to shift much of the cost of copays, deductibles and coinsurance onto their workers. the center for american progress calculated how many will feel the crunch:8. hospitals are going to feel the crunch as well: hospitals aren t happy with the new bill and it is easy to see why, when you consider it will cause a large spike in uncompensated care for hospitals across all states: 9. finally, the new bill will cause massive job loss, particularly in the health care sector: by 2026, more than 1.45 million jobs will be lost as a direct result of the bcra go by the results of a report by the commonwealth fund and george washington university. in fact, the report goes as far as to say that every state except hawaii would have fewer jobs and a weaker economy,  however, it s not just health care employment that will be affected, but also retail and construction as well:so if you thought this latest rewrite of the gop s health care legislation didn t affect you, you more than likely thought wrongly. even if it isn t your health care that is directly affected, chances are you will still feel the ripple effects of the bill on the economy, both on a state and national level.featured image via drew angerer/getty images',\n",

              " 'donald trump s obsession with twitter and inability to concentrate on any concept more complex than a sentence or two is now being put to use by his desperate staff.trump is about to embark on a high-stakes, crucial sitdown with russian president vladimir putin at the g20 summit in europe. unfortunately for america, he cannot concentrate on learning anything before he goes. trump is infamous for refusing to read intelligence briefings (or read anything, really), but his lack of focus has only gotten worse as his poll numbers slide and his petty fights with morning show hosts and his golf trips consume most of his days.his frantic staff is down to one last move to get him to read a few facts before sitting down with putin. what follows is one of, perhaps, the most pathetic things you ll ever read.here s what sources told the la times about how trump s team is getting the president to read up on the adversary who interfered in the 2016 presidential election just months ago:the profile, according to two u.s. officials, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss the preparations, is part of a thick binder prepared for trump. the president often doesn t read the usual briefing books and relies on in-person briefings, the officials said, so aides also have written a list of tweet-length sentences that summarize the main points trump could bring up with putin.having thoroughly killed the reputation of the white house in a variety of ways, trump now isn t even expected to read anything longer than a tweet. and his republican allies in congress don t seem to find anything wrong with that.there is a growing sense, both in washington and around the country, that the executive branch no longer functionally exists. trump watches an estimated 5 hours of television a day. he tweets at his enemies, sometimes using memes created by racists and which made their way to his desk in mysterious, disturbing ways. he visits his properties and golfs. the rare time staff can get him to actually work on something gets derailed by trump s incessant ego and casual obliviousness. his staff is now encouraged to bring up trump and his election win as often as possible. they are told to not contradict him when he says something factually untrue. sometimes he ll leave fox news running in the background while his staff tries to conduct business.even that was too much work, apparently. now he needs 140 characters or less or his mind will wander to right-wing memes and personal attacks on his enemies. and he appears to be getting worse.featured image via mark wilson/getty images',\n",

              " 'ever since the historic ruling that made same-sex marriage legal in all 50 states in june 2015, opponents cried that it s a war against them. but, is it really? it seems like it s a war against those in a same-sex marriage, even by those in the courthouse. rather than live and let live, people enjoy making others miserable.what should be the defenders and upholders of justice have let same-sex spouses down in texas when the texas supreme court ruled that the constitution does not clearly require states to extend spousal benefits to same-sex couples. this decision came friday. the ruling was unanimous, making it clear that they do not believe in justice or marriage equality.the texas supreme court interpreted the ruling of obergefell v. hodges narrowly, questioning whether it compels states to treat same-sex couples equally to opposite-sex couples in any context outside of marriage licensing. i guess we shouldn t expect anything better from texas.friday s ruling of pidgeon v. turner revolves around spousal benefits for government workers. texas law prohibits same-sex couples from receiving such benefits. how that is even possible is beyond me.slate reports that according to the court, obergefell  did not address and resolve  the  specific issue  of state spousal benefits. therefore, the state appeals court erred in ordering the trial court to resolve the case  consistent with obergefell and de leon.  instead, the texas supreme court insisted, the trial court must settle the issue itself keeping in mind that obergefell  did not hold that states must provide the same publicly funded benefits to all married persons. i am flabbergasted. how can judges, meant to serve justice, deny justice? how can they interpret rulings and laws this way? they re bending the ruling to their will because on a personal level they probably don t like same-sex marriage.my heart goes out to all the same-sex spouses that are not receiving fair and equal spousal benefits.featured image via robert daemmrich photography inc/corbis/getty images',\n",

              " 'donald trump woke up on wednesday morning and lashed out at the media again.the temper tantrum was aimed at the new york times because they talked to a republican senator who attended a meeting at the white house trump organized to discuss the healthcare bill.earlier this week, the congressional budget office reported that the trumpcare bill will cause 22 million americans to lose their insurance and that premiums would skyrocket by 74 percent on top of taking away many of the protections that the affordable care act currently provides.faced with heavy opposition to the republican repeal effort, trump invited senate republicans to the white house to discuss the matter. it did not go well. the meeting went off the rails because, the senators found, trump doesn t know a damn thing about the bill.according to the new york times,a senator who supports the bill left the meeting at the white house with a sense that the president did not have a grasp of some basic elements of the senate plan   and seemed especially confused when a moderate republican complained that opponents of the bill would cast it as a massive tax break for the wealthy.again, the times spoke to a person who was actually at the meeting.but trump whined about the report anyway and complained that the times did not call him to confirm the story, which we all know he would not have done because trump thinks any news story about his incompetence is  fake news. the failing @nytimes writes false story after false story about me. they don t even call to verify the facts of a story. a fake news joke!  donald j. trump (@realdonaldtrump) june 28, 2017trump even laughably claimed that he know all about healthcare.some of the fake news media likes to say that i am not totally engaged in healthcare. wrong, i know the subject well & want victory for u.s.  donald j. trump (@realdonaldtrump) june 28, 2017in reality, trump has admitted that he doesn t know much about healthcare in america. back in february, he told a meeting of governors that  nobody knew health care could be so complicated. apparently, trump is the only person in this country who didn t know that healthcare is a complicated issue in america. one can t exactly  know the subject well  if one has no clue how complicated the subject is.featured image: joe raedle/getty images',\n",
              " 'protests against trumpcare are ramping up now that the congressional budget office has released their assessment of the bill. and not surprisingly, republican senators are sinking to all-time lows to avoid the angry constituents begging for the gop not to take away their health care. last week they were dragging people out of wheelchairs to haul them off to jail and this week they re throwing priests behind bars.six protesters were arrested on monday for protesting the repeal of obamacare at sen. shelley moore capito s office in charleston, wv, who has yet to decide how she will vote on the bill. one of the protestors who ended up in handcuffs was rev. jim lewis. for the party that claims to be all about christian values, it sure is ironic that they having a man of god arrested because he asked them not to kill the poor and sick. just saying.the washington journal reports:so, for six hours, several dozen west virginians stood outside the office calling for their junior senator to protect their healthcare, while six went into capito s office and staged a sit-in. at 5:30 pm, protesters inside were told that the office was closing and they would be arrested if they did not leave.the videos below, livestreamed on facebook, show the protesters calmly and peacefully explaining their cause and the disaster they were committed to avoiding. police officers   seemingly with reluctance, if not sympathy   told them they would be charged with trespassing and taken to jail if they did not leave.committed to the moral imperative that is stopping trumpcare, the protesters made clear that if the choice was between jail or backing down, the decision was easy.gary zuckett, executive director of the west virginia citizen action group which helped organize the event along with west virginia citizen action group, rise up west virginia and kanawha valley democratic socialists of america, said they were there to try to get through to capito just how many of her constituents will be hurt if this bill becomes law. the idea is, we need to send a message to sen. capito that this is not an acceptable direction for our country to be going,  he said.  it s going to hurt west virginia, it s going to hurt our economy, it s going to put a lot of the rural health clinics at risk, it may close some rural hospitals. it s definitely going to harm her constituents when they lose their health care coverage, especially with the medicaid expansion. you can watch video of a gop senator having a priest arrested here:featured image via charleston gazette-mail',\n",

              " 'according to a new report, health insurance premiums will shoot up 74% for the average american under the health care bill being served up by the republican senate. older customers will be hit even harder with some paying twice as much for plans comparable to what they currently have.the nonpartisan group kaiser family foundation analyzed the costs for individual market plans that cover 70% of medical costs   what most obamacare plans cover   and factored in insurance prices and subsidies under the republican bill.mitch mcconnel s health bill encourages customers to purchase plans with high deductibles, reduces subsidies for lower-income americas, and allows insurers to charge older people more.these changes would result in plans varying dramatically due to age and income, with low-income and older persons suffering the most.people between 55 and 64 would see an increase of 115$ on average, which is more than double the obama care prices. low-income americans who make less than $24,000 a year would receive an increase of 177$, versus only 57% for people that bring in more money.younger and higher income americans will see less sweeping changes in their insurance premiums.customers who have the disadvantage of being bother older and low-income will see premiums go up 294%, an increase of almost fourfold.the senior vice president for special initiatives at kaiser family foundation, larry levitt, weighed in on the drastic situation. faced with premiums almost quadrupling, many of these low-income adults would tend to either go without coverage entirely because it s unaffordable or gravitate towards a plan with lower premiums and higher deductibles. the congressional budget office even admits this bill is going to be disastrous for americans. their own analysis concluded that premiums will most likely be too high for low-income americans to purchase coverage, causing millions more to be stranded without insurance than under the current health care law.photo by drew angerer/getty images',\n",
              " 'the congressional budget office released their report on the senate s version of the republican  health care  bill on monday, and it was not good news. according to their analysis, a whopping 22 million americans will lose their insurance coverage if the bill becomes law. but that is not the extent of the cruelty in this legislation.the cbo report revealed that much like the house version, the senate bill is especially callous when it comes to the lives of those who are sick, disabled, or elderly   you know, the people that need health care the most.if the bill were to pass, older americans would see their premiums skyrocket. under obamacare, the average cost of insurance coverage for a 64-year-old with an income of $56,800 is $6,800 annually. but under the senate bill, dubbed the better care reconciliation act, that same 64-year-old would see their premiums rise to $20,500 per year. that means 36 percent of grandma s income will be going to insurance premiums, which does not include the costs of co-pays, deductibles, etc.cbo analysis bcra premiums, via twitterthe big brag of this bill is that it will lower premiums for the young and middle-aged (a little bit), assuming they are healthy, of course. but here s the thing, no one stays young and healthy forever. some might argue that the whole point of having health care is so you have the opportunity to get old in the first place.unless you die a tragic death before your time (probably from gun violence if you are in the u.s., but i digress), you are going to get old. that much is a guarantee. it s an either-or thing, not a maybe. and the chances are pretty good that sooner or later, you are going to get sick. which, once again, is the whole point of having health insurance to begin with. but under the gop bill, getting sick means you now have one of those nifty pre-existing condition things.so no matter how you look at it, the only way to avoid paying sky-high premiums under the bcra is to die. this bill may be a lot of things, but it sure as hell isn t  health care. featured image via win mcnamee/getty images',\n",
